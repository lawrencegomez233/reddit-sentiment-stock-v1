        "selftext": "Howdy, folks. Long-time lurker posting from a throwaway account, but I am eager for any advice Personal Finance might have for me.\n\nA little background: my parents are retired in their mid-70s and are doing great for themselves--house and cars are paid off, all of us kids are grown and out of school/supporting ourselves, and they have enough money coming in each year from social security and their state pensions ($150k total + COLA annually) that they can basically do as they please. They are in pretty good health for their ages and are working to stay that way. All this is to say that the performance of their investments and retirement accounts are really secondary concerns, since they have more than enough in guaranteed SSI/pension income to live the lives they want--they're not currently drawing down any investments and don't plan to.\n\nMy concern: my parents were fortunate enough to invest in Apple in the early 2010s, and their Apple stock has since ballooned in value after all the stock splits etc. to the tune of ~1.5 million dollars held in a taxable brokerage, the oldest shares having a cost basis of around $15. They also have about $500k in other securities in a traditional IRA. So we're talking like 75% or more of their investments being just in Apple stock. My father wants to leave this as his legacy to me and my siblings, and is very proud of the wealth he and my mom have built.\n\nI've talked to my father about the risk of holding so much in just one company, but he doesn't want to pay the 15% capital gains taxes that would be involved in selling the stock to diversify their holdings--he thinks it is better for us to inherit the stock at the stepped up cost basis when he and my mom pass, rather than sending 15% of the gains to Uncle Sam. \n\nNone of us kids need or expect the money--and I honestly hope it won't even be an issue for many more years. But he's asked me for advice and I'm not sure what to tell him. Is there a third option besides hold / sell and pay the taxes?\n\nThank you all in advance for you time and insight!",

In addition to that, 5 days later there were two more fraudulent charges onto my new card totaling $1,000.

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm 24 and landed my dream job a year ago making 90k. I was driving my dad‚Äôs old car at first, so cost wasn‚Äôt an issue at all. But someone rear ended me and it got totaled in Jan so I had to buy a new car in Feb. I wanted something that would last and that I liked so I got a 2024 Hyundai Kona for around 25k.\n\nPaid 8k down (from the insurance payout on the wrecked car), and I pay $420 per month just for the car payment. I definitely thought I could afford it, but now one of my roommates is moving out and my rent is increasing from by about $500 per month to roughly $2k per month, for the next 9ish months.\n\nNow my car payment and car insurance payment are a little over $600 per month in total, and my take home pay is a little over $4,500 per month. So while I‚Äôm not completely screwed, I only end up with like $100 or maybe $200 going into my savings every month which seems ridiculous.\n\nMy gut instinct is to sell the car (privately?) and buy something way cheaper. I love my car to death but this does not seem sustainable.\n\nI never really learned how to budget anything so I‚Äôm totally winging this. I don‚Äôt have anyone to ask for help and I have no clue what a reasonable budget looks like.\n\nI‚Äôve written out my budget in extreme detail and  really the rest of it is just groceries, gas, utilities, pet insurance, and like a couple small subscription services like Spotify and Amazon. I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm drowning.\n\nWould welcome any resources that could help me figure out how to reasonably budget, and any advice on how others would handle this.\n\nEdit: Really really appreciate all the perspective here. You are all totally right, I was dishonest about the roommate bit of the story. Roommate is actually my abusive boyfriend who I am kicking out. I pay 2/3 of the rent, he pays the remainder ($500). With him gone, I pay it all. I think that was probably my fatal mistake, not the car.\n\nWe do live in a pretty HCOL area. I spend about $75 per week on groceries but sometimes go over. It‚Äôs not really enough lol. I eat out maybe 2-3 times per week, probably spend about $15-20 each time. I really don‚Äôt go out beyond that.\n\nHere‚Äôs my actual budget. Mayo refers to Mayo Clinic, not mayonnaise. I have tons of medical issues so I have a monthly required payment for all the appointments there.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/lJDkDGW\n\nEdit #2: Thank you so much for all the help. A few clarifications:\n\nSomeone pointed out that my eating out budget as laid out in my budget spreadsheet is inaccurate. I totally missed that and it should read closer to ~200 per month at max. Thanks for catching that! I will be aiming to cut down on eating out now.\n\nI know this probably doesn‚Äôt instill much faith in the rest of the budget but I double checked everything and I do believe the rest is accurate.\n\nIn terms of CC, I have about $800 on the Apple Card which I just try to meet the monthly on. Some people have indicated that I should pay this off more aggressively so I will try that from now on.\n\nFor the Amex, I am on my mom‚Äôs card and having a tough time getting her to remove me. I don‚Äôt spend on it really ever, but I put a few bucks on it every month to help her out. This probably sounds insane given the state of my budget. I will try to have a conversation about stopping those payments.\n\nAnd lastly, I live in basically a 1 bedroom, 2 bathroom. We also have a room that is referred to on the floor plan as a den. I‚Äôm not sure if my landlord would allow me to add a roommate to live in the den? Or if anyone would even want to pay $1000 to live in a den. It‚Äôs decently small, but could probably fit a small bed and desk if you really tried. Really just not sure on the legality of that I guess since it isn‚Äôt referred to as a bedroom.\n\nI will present the situation to my landlord and ask about moving to a different unit as a solution.\n\nEdit #3: I did the IRS tax withholding estimator and I actually don‚Äôt withhold enough apparently. For federal, I have $349.69 coming out per paycheck, and state is $60.32 per paycheck. It says I should withhold an additional $35 per pay period.\n\n$199.97 per paycheck goes into Social Security, and I put $159.61 per paycheck into my HSA. The HSA amount is pretty non negotiable unfortunately, I have a lot of medical bills.\n\nThank you so much for all the help!! I‚Äôm sorry for leaving out some details initially, this is all new to me. Please feel free to ask any other clarifying questions!\n\n\n\n",

My wife and I did stop at two out of area stores yesterday, so I wasn't entirely surprised, because I did not see the charges from one of them clear my account yet. Figured maybe that's what triggered everything, or where they got the info from. \nThey asked if I did tap to pay or inserted my card, and I informed them I used apple pay.\nThe guy made me feel comfortable, so when he asked for my bank login username to help track it down the IP, I absent mindedly answered. 30 seconds later I realized \"wait a minute, they never ask that....shit\"\n30 seconds or so of conversation and brief holds while the system catches up, he asks me to verify the first 5 of my SSN. \"No\" was my response.\n\"No problem sir, I'll see if I can bypass that so we can continue getting this multi factor authentication enabled for you. One moment\" and the red flags were waving like crazy.\nI ask the guy for his name, and he gives me a name and a banking ID number, and I ask \"And I'll get an email with full documentation on this?\" \n\"Yes sir, we'll send it to the e-mail on file\"\n\"And can you verify what e-mail you'll be sending this to?\" and they hung up on me. \n\nI tried calling the bank immediately afterwards, and their phones are down. They are still down. I even tried from a neighbors phone incase mine was acting up. Their phones are still down 5 hours after they called me. \n\nWhat they got from me: Full billing address, bank username (not password), last 4 of social, and verification of my wife's maiden name is on the account. I immediately transferred everything I could to a friend since I cannot get a hold of anyone at my bank likely until Monday (unless they can get their phones back on and will open up a line). \n\nI feel so damn stupid.

        "selftext": "This post arises out of some thoughts I had after my friend got robbed recently. We don‚Äôt talk much on this sub about the risks that having your finances electronically integrated into your smartphone poses, but my friends situation demonstrates what can go wrong.\n\nAfter a late night at the bars, my friend was jumped and the attackers took his wallet and made him give them the passcode to his phone, draining his checking account and gaining access to all his cards on applepay. He was effectively helpless for 3-4 days. The robbers took all of his credit cards (both the ones in his wallet and applepay) and so he needed to cancel all of them immediately. He had no access to a payment method  for food, a new phone, or anything else. His dad had to ship him a new phone (they took his id so he couldn‚Äôt even pick one up that had been pre paid) and DoorDash him food for a few days until he got everything together.\n\nThis got me thinking that I‚Äôm (and probably a lot of people) are in a very similar situation. All my cards are on applepay with the exception of one. I also carry them in my wallet just in case. However, if either my wallet or phone gets stolen, I have to cancel them all anyway. I leave one card at home just in case, but I fear if I report a theft on the other card on the account that they will close both cards. My bank account can also be accessed using my phones password. \n\nWhat does Plan B look like from a personal finance perspective? Here are a few things that come to mind: \n\n1. Should I have a store of emergency cash? How much would you store? I don‚Äôt want too much money out of my savings accounts or investments not accruing interest. \n\n2.How can I theft proof my bank accounts and credit cards? If they have access to my phone password it‚Äôs all over. Conversely, if I carry my cards in my wallet and they steal it then it‚Äôs also over. I have four cards that I potentially need to use on a daily basis and can leave only one card at home and off Apple Pay.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to ever end up as helpless and vulnerable as my friend, what is your solution?

        "selftext": "I was injured in a car crash last year and I'm finally receiving the settlement money, after all the bills it comes down to around $17k.  \n  \nI'm only 19, I haven't had my first job yet (although im trying to find one) and I really want to be financially responsible with the money since I understand most people my age don't usually come into this amount of money. I was considering using 1.5k of it to buy a used car from my boyfriend's sister which she's been trying to sell because I don't have a car yet and I think having reliable transportation would open a lot of doors for me, help me to more independent, and help with getting a job among other things. Although, I understand that buying a car would mean paying for gas, insurance, registration, and repairs if necessary which I will probably be forced to use the settlement money on unless I can quickly find a job.  \n  \nMy dad is really against the idea, he keeps opting that I just borrow his car when I need it so all I need to pay is insurance, but I know if I do that then I won't have the autonomy I really want with a car. I'm very tired of being dependent on my boyfriend for rides, or anybody really. I feel bad inconveniencing people with it. My boyfriend doesn't seem to mind too much, but it just bothers me. There are things I want to do by myself that I can't do by myself because I don't have a car, and I don't think my dad would be for me using his car for those activities either because of gas. He wants me to use the car for needs, not wants. I suppose the fix here is offering to pay for gas myself. I'm just stuck though, could this be a good opportunity for me to gain some independence by buying my first car or should I continue to rely on my dad's until I at least have a job?\n\nAside from this, I really *want* to use the money for other things too: a good gaming pc and maybe an iphone, just upgrades I've been wanting for years. I've been an android user forever because that's what my dad put me on. It's fine, but I honestly wish I could get the exclusive features apple users get. I'm a sucker for customizability, I want facetime, and there are so many things that just operate better on ios compared to android because that's what most apps cater to. The main selling point for me though is the good camera. I really hate my samsung camera. I've been stuck with it for YEARS, the lighting in every picture is always terrible, and almost every time I take a selfie it slaps a filter on top that I can't remove which makes the photo look awful. I am so discouraged from taking photos because of how bad that camera is, and it upsets me because I feel like I miss out on documenting my experiences. I rely almost completely on my boyfriend for photo-taking now, and they always look so good on his iphone 11. I've asked for an iphone as a birthday gift for multiple years, but my dad has always refused. Now I finally have the money to buy one, but don't know if I should. \n\nOn the other hand, I know digital cameras produce absoloutely BREATH-TAKING pictures, better than iphone imo. I'm wondering if buying a good digital camera and sticking to my samsung would be a better investment if I were to buy something to upgrade my photos.\n\nI've also never had my own laptop or computer, everything I've ever used in that category has belonged to my dad and while they've always gotten the job done, they're of course not designed with gaming in mind. I love playing games, but have been stuck solely to nintendo products because those were the consoles my dad bought when I was younger (Wii, Wii U, Nintendo Switch). I like my switch, but being stuck to this one company limits me a lot and I really want to upgrade to my own pc so I can explore more titles. I understand that a solid top-notch pc costs around 2k though, and getting into pc-building is a whole other can of worms. It honestly would be a dream come true to make this upgrade, I've wanted my own desktop since I was in 5th grade, but don't think it's the most responsible decision.\n\nOverall, I'm just not sure how much I should allow myself to spend, what to spend on, and how much I should save, I know high-yield saving accounts exist too but since I only just opened my bank account to hold the settlement money, I don't yet completely understand how to do that. I've know investing could be a good decision as well but I know that carries some risk, so i'm not sure how worth-it that route is.  \n  \nSorry for the wall of text, guidance would just be greatly appreciated from those more experienced than me!",

If it matters at all, im also in college as a pre nursing student.

        "title": "I have no idea how I could save for retirement outside of 401k (which isn‚Äôt enough) due to household income. ",
        "selftext": "I want to express that my husband and I recognize our good fortune with a household income of $300k, but I regret some financial decisions we've made.\n\nBackground: \n\nI'm 31 and my husband is 34. Although our income seems high, our savings and retirement plans are concerning, especially with a baby on the way. Earlier this year, we depleted our savings to pay off debts like student loans and car payments, leaving us with only our mortgage (still owe $100k). \n\nMy husband graduated at 23 and reached a salary of over $80k, but he had $40k in student debt and didn‚Äôt start saving until about 4-5 years ago due to limited financial literacy. I graduated at 25, only earning a salary (60k) after covering school expenses. As a result, both of us began contributing to retirement and savings later in life, starting slowly as we built an emergency fund and because we bought a house.\n\nFinances:\n\nNow I make around $126k & husband makes $175k. Bring total household income before tax at = $301k\n\nDebt: We emptied most of our savings at the beginning of this year because we both had large jumps in salary and something got messed up on our w4‚Äôs (we work at the same company) and owed 10k in taxes, we paid off our student loans, the siding of our house, our car note (we have 1 car for now until baby comes), etc. \n\nSavings: We penny pinched and now we are at 30k for savings and 10k for upcoming baby expenses for the next year. We both work in Tech and with layoffs constantly happening we‚Äôve been advised to save as if one of us could not find a job for a year. \n\nRetirement: I only have $74k in 401k, and was only able to save 10k in Roth/traditional IRA. My husband has 100k in 401k (nothing else). I keep seeing you need 1x your salary in retirement before 30 to stay on track IF we still have social security (which I can‚Äôt count on). \n\nHousehold expenses: We‚Äôre remote employees so moved to a new state and got a 2 year lease to see if we wanted to permanently move (but we‚Äôve decided to move back to our home to save money). We‚Äôre required to have our own offices with a lock so we‚Äôre trying to buy a new home with baby coming (current home is a 2 bedroom turned 3 (dinning room was turned into a bedroom). \n\nMortgage: $1000\n\nRent (until March 2025): $ 3000\n\nTotal Utilities: $ 350\n\nCar/house/renters insurance: $ 337\nInternet: $ 100\n\nSubscriptions (includes pet insurance, gym, Costco, apple care, cancer insurance, and streaming): $ 283\n\nMisc bills: $1900\n\nTotal expenses for now= $6970\n\nTotal expenses once we move back to our house in March = $ 3970 (not included extra baby stuff and new car note).\n\nConcern: I feel like there are no additional options for savings outside of our 401k and just a HYS account. We jumped salaries kinda quickly (before we even knew anything about financial literacy) so we never took advantage of IRAs before we legally  no longer could contribute to them without being double taxed. High yield savings accounts don‚Äôt build wealth, and I don‚Äôt see us ever being able to retire. Especially because we plan to pay for our child‚Äôs college so they can have a better start at life than we did (especially a better life than me because I grew up dirt poor, like my family wouldn‚Äôt be able to eat or go to the doctor without us having lived in a super awesome state that had generous social services). \n\nWe have a good savings potential but realistically it‚Äôs not enough to grow the way a retirement account would. We‚Äôre learning about finances as we go along and had no guidance but the internet. What are our options? \n\nEdit (1): Forgot to mention we both have medical issues that will not make retirement age less costly even if a home is paid off. They will get worse with age and husband will most certainly need a heart transplant later in life. Luckily nothing we‚Äôd pass on to baby but still stinks!",

Usually, I pay with an Apple Credit Card. I‚Äôm not very financially versed so please bear with me.\n\nIn 2023, I flew them twice and spent $928.11.

We also had a Delta one way flight for both of us that could have been southwest but my boyfriend chose that one. \n\nSo far in 2025, we used my account to fly him here and I‚Äôve booked my visit for June-August, so total spent has been $905.52. We plan on flying to New York for a week in the summer, which is looking like it will cost $772.74 including all fees. I will also be going there for winter break one way which will cost $213.18. After that, we go to my and his family for the holidays, which will total minimum $925.12. Then, he flies back in very early January for $233.18. Minimum total for 2025 is $3049.74. I always get the cheapest flight at the lowest tier that works for the trip and our schedule. \n\nI graduate next year, so there will most likely be only one more visit before then, as well as plane tickets for him to come to my graduation and for us to move wherever we move (although we will probably end up driving) After that, outside of maybe holidays I don‚Äôt see myself flying too often. I sometimes wish I had gotten it sooner but I can‚Äôt change the past, and I can‚Äôt even really tell if it would have been worth it.\n\nRight now, Southwest is having a promotion where if you apply today you can get a companion pass through 2/28/26 plus 30k bonus points after spending $4k in the first 3 months.
