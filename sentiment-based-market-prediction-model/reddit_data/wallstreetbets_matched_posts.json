        "title": "Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase",
        "selftext": "Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.\n\nAccording to a report in the Information, Apple ‚Äî which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout ‚Äî has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\n\nThe update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.\n\nLast year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.\n\nIt's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.\n\nAccording to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.\n\nNotably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like \"Severance,\" \"Shrinking,\" and \"Ted Lasso.\" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to \"Coda\").\n\nIn total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.\n\nApple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.\n\n\"Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,\" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. \"Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.\"\n\nIn January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",

Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.**\n\n**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**\n\nDISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.\n\n  \n‚ÄúI believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We‚Äôre a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.‚Äù\n\n\\--Donald Trump, 1988\n\n\n\n[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.\n\nThis has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of \"loopholes\" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.\n\nTheir goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:\n\n* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that \"deindustrialization is a national security risk\".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that \"every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait.\" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.\n* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.\n\nSo, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.\n\nWhat does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that \"liberation day\" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to \"buy the dip.\" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.\n\n**\\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**\n\n**\"TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA\" --me**\n\n**\"THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP\" --me**\n\n**\"TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD\" --me**\n\nHowever, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of \"reducing the trade deficit with China\" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and \"reindustrialize\" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.\n\ntl;dr: Since the goal is to \"Reduce the trade deficit with China,\" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.\n\n**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**\n\nI think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.\n\nWho are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...\n\nNavarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is \"ripping off the world.\" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.\n\nAre these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:\n\n**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to \"decouple\" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**\n\n**He believes in \"short term pain,\" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the \"dependency\" on China.**\n\nSimply put:\n\nAAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.\n\nHowever, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the \"apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip\" reflex continues over the rest of the week.\n\n\\---\n\n**Epilogue**  \nUneducated peasants gave Mao Zedong power because he was an iconoclast that claimed he could save them from a feudalistic society. When in power, he instead implemented his theory that none of his base understood.\n\n45 million starved. The rest ate bark and dirt.",

The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?\n\n  \nOutstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.\n\nTechnology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.\n\nGlobal market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.\n\nIf chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.\n\nNow for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. You're paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.\n\nThat fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.\n\nI agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html)\n\nThere is one area that will benefit astronomically from AI but that will come a bit later.",

The main difference now is that there is AI and a better overall experience that can be sold at a higher price than usual. I can see how they will try to implement a better paywalled AI around the release of iOS 19, boosting other services with an Apple One pack. \n\n# No one upgrades, except this time\n\nOlder iPhones are not AI capable, and everyone that wants the new toy will have a reason to upgrade, the first real reason to upgrade since the iPhone X release. \n\n\n\nNot to mention the countless memes we will get, 2008 style dumb Siri videos. Unrelated, but can't wait for it.   \n\n\n\n\nAll considered I think they will get a huge boost in revenue, more fidelization and better diversification.

        "title": "Trimming Appl before Berkshire results tomorrow ",
        "selftext": "Investors may want to consider trimming their Apple (AAPL) positions based on recent developments and upcoming events. Here's why:\n\n## Apple's Recent Performance\n\nApple's latest earnings report has raised some concerns among investors. The company reported a decline in global iPhone sales for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to increased competition in China from companies like Huawei[3]. This slowdown in Apple's flagship product could signal challenges ahead for the tech giant.\n\n## Berkshire Hathaway's Significant Reduction\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) has made a notable move by cutting its stake in Apple by nearly 50% during the second quarter of 2024[1][2]. This reduction came after Berkshire had already trimmed its Apple holdings by 13% in the first quarter[1]. Such a significant divestment by a long-term, value-focused investor like Buffett could be interpreted as a cautionary signal.\n\n## Potential for Further Trimming\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway set to report earnings tomorrow, investors should pay close attention. Apple's stock price has risen by approximately $15 since the end of September when Berkshire made its substantial cut. This increase, coupled with Berkshire's recent selling pattern, suggests that another trim in Berkshire's Apple holdings is possible[4].\n\n## Broader Market Considerations\n\nBerkshire's actions may reflect broader concerns about the U.S. economy. The company has increased its cash reserves to a record $277 billion, which could indicate a more cautious outlook on equities in general[5]. This substantial cash position might be seen as a hedge against potential market volatility or economic uncertainty.\n\n## Investor Takeaway\n\nWhile Apple remains a strong company with significant market presence, these factors combined suggest that investors might want to reassess their positions:\n\n1. Apple's slowing iPhone sales and increased competition\n2. Berkshire's substantial reduction in Apple holdings\n3. The possibility of further trimming by Berkshire\n4. Overall market and economic uncertainties\n\nGiven that the onions for appl options will be down after earnings, this would be an excellent time to short appl. This is not financial advice.\n\nSources\n[1] Apple Stock Falls Amid Broad Selloff as Berkshire Hathaway Trims ... https://www.investopedia.com/apple-stock-falls-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-trims-stake-again-8690248\n[2] Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Cuts Stake in Apple by Half https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2024/buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-cuts-stake-in-apple-by-half/\n[3] Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sells half its Apple stock https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/03/warren-buffets-berkshire-hathaway-sells-half-its-apple-stock/\n[4] Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cuts stake in Apple by nearly ... https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/business/berkshire-hathaway-apple-stock/index.html\n[5] Berkshire Hathaway sells off large share of Apple and increases ... https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/03/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-sells-off-apple-increases-cash-holdings\n",

        "selftext": "Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since¬†[the launch of ChatGPT¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[¬†a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)¬†in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n\nAhead of the¬†[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies ‚Äî Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),¬†[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) ‚Äî formed what would come to be known as the¬†[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[¬†three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

Some of you regards might say that \"OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED\", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.\n\nFirst of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are \"worth now\".\n\n|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AAPL|230|1,4|164|\n|MSFT|413|2,95|140|\n|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|\n|META|516|5,16|100|\n|AMZN|171|1,26|135|\n|NVDA|116|0,68|170|\n\nAs you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.\n\nBut before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.\n\n## AAPL\n\nLatest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.\n\nHow do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.\n\nBut this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo \"Vision Pro\" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.\n\n## MSFT\n\nThey did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a \"everything\" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.\n\nThey are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.\n\nThey are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?\n\n## AMD\n\nI am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.\n\nAlso, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.\n\nEven if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.\n\nAnd no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section.\n\n## META\n\nThey are a \"AD\" company, just like Google. They have some \"long game\" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.\n\nALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.\n\n## AMZN\n\nThe \"everything company\". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.\n\n# NVDA\n\nAND OUR STAR CHILD.\nHOT TOPIC OF 2024.\nTHE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.\n\nDo you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.\n\nSo why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.\n\nRemember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?\n\nH100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.\n\nAnd I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.\n\nRemember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?\n\nLet the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.\n\nEDIT: forgor some words",

        "selftext": "January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school.\n\nApril 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S\\*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts.  I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more.\n\nMay 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96%\n\nJune 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says \"APPLE INTELLIGENCE\", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June.\n\nJuly 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up \\~80-100% for the year.\n\nLook, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time.\n\nJuly 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week:  1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish.  Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0.\n\nToo hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times.\n\nOver the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are.\n\nAMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production.  $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck?  I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point.\n\nTLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October.   Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week.\n\nI'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS.\n\nThanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",
