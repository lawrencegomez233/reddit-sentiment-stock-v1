But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming, I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. \n\nAlso, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.\n\nDo you think Apple will likely see more downside with this Administration or will it likely be more or less the same fate as rest of the Tech stocks? Is Trump Victory ultimately agnostic to Apple's future?",

This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.\n\nIn this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.\n\nTo clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.\n\nMeta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.\n\n# Unrealized (current investments)\n\n* **Meta (META):** \\+367.97%\n* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \\+117.05%\n\nNvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \\~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.\n\nThese returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.\n\n# Rate of return (IRR)\n\nMy annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.\n\n# Investment thesis\n\nSee a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**\n\n>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

We have a lot of users calling for Fed to cut interest rates, in hope that the rate cut will push economic growth and reduce treasury yield. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to increase interest rate, so it makes USD more appealing and reduces treasury yield. Regardless, treasury yield keeps going up. The same story of basis trade and carry trade is playing again today.\n\nIt is debatable whether we want a stronger dollar or a weak dollar, but reducing treasury yield seems to be the common goal. How could we easily create more demands for U.S. treasury bonds, when both sides of the aisle embraces the deficit expansion to the core? Well, we can force people into buying treasury bonds, we can wage a war to scare people, or we can create some phantom demands. This is where the GENIUS act may come handy.\n\nThe grand scheme is to bring assets on-chain, which requires the players to escrow real-world-assets (RWAs) and issue tokens backed with it. Geez, this sounds like mortgage backed securities and ETF already. To trade those assets, we need currencies, mostly the stablecoins. The GENIUS Act requires holding of USD or treasury bonds, which the issuers will gladly support. Let us imagine that we move NYSE and NASDAQ on-chain and create a copy of all stocks, we suddenly create demand for USD, treasury, and stocks from some users that can't access the U.S. market. Even our dear general Kim can tornado his stash and buy Apple at that time.\n\nWait! This already happened! Kraken tokenized AAPL, NVDA and TSLA today. Many other crypto firms have worked on RWA for years, including stocks, game skins, etc. GAINS even created a 100x leveraged stock trading platform until they halted it due to heavy admin burden to monitor stock earning, dividends, splits, acquisitions, etc.\n\nSo we are likely to see a concerted effort to push assets on-chain in the coming months or years, which will benefit stocks like COIN, HOOD, XYZ, PYPL, and other players, and cryptos such as LINK. Electronic stablecoin payments for daily life is another direction, and I wonder how that will affect V and MA. The damage to both may take years though.\n\nToo bad I didn't scoop HOOD at low, but I bought all above anyway.",

Unfortunately I did not realize this and purchased AAPL at $188.xx, what it had ended at on Friday and said it was trading at on IBKR lite and Tickertech/Apple stocks. I happened to go over to Robinhood where I had deposited some funds to trade overnight and went to purchase another share of AAPL where I found it was trading at $178.xx. \\*cringe\\* Where does RH source their live data and where do I get more of this info if I want to move away from Robinhood in the future? Is overnight/after hours live trading data standardized (ie there's one source) or does it vary depending on the quality of the data? Ideally I'd like to get this for free.

        "selftext": "I’m curious to know where people stand on whether they think they should place their own trades in IRA accounts vs buying index funds and etfs. I’m on the side of active only because I know what I’m doing especially during high volatility when I’m able to pick up stocks at lower prices during or after selloffs. This concentrated buying has allowed me to see pretty big upside when the stock rebounds especially if it rises more than the index. The risks of this is that SPY/QQQ has been rising consistently. I have been really conservative about buying tech thinking the market will pull back and I have missed out big as a result. My YTD would be around 30-40% if I didn’t sell my positions early but that’s life. \n\nMe (Roth IRA): 19.35% YTD\n\nMy 401k: 15.27%\n\nS&P: 18.61% YTD\n\nNasdaq 100: 20.83% YTD\n\nMy biggest winners include\n\n-RKLB. 37.92%. $4.05. I think this is a 5-10 year play. I buy on dips. I’m too afraid to sell covered calls on this for fear of the price running without me.\n\n-Arm bought near 52 week low and sold around $80 thinking it was overvalued… I bought back with a small stake at $120 begrudgingly only to see it rise to $170.\n\n-hood. Bought at $8, sold for $9.50…. Thought it would keep ping ponging. Bought back at $20 and will average down if need be but the company is not going out of business\n\n-rivn. Up 35% YTD, my biggest position. I bought slightly high but kept averaging down. I actually believe in the company. Cost basis $12.94.\n\n-aapl. Up 20% YTD. I have a small stake because I kept waiting for Apple to drop to $130 before rising to $200 which did not happen. Cost basis $195.\n\n-Bcrx. Up 58% YTD. I’ve known this bio company for almost a decade now. They ping pong so it’s mostly cyclical. $4.65 cost basis \n\n-cava. Up 26% YTD. Kicking myself for not buying more. \n\n-SG. Bought at like $9, sold at like $13. Kicking myself. I bought after reading about their subscription service and seeing how people are paying $20 for their orders\n\n-FBTC. Up 16.98%. Cost basis $47.14. Bitcoin is here to stay like it or not. Wish I didn’t penny pinch when trying to buy 100 shares of MSTR 2 years ago for $500. \n\n-HUM. +19.52%, $323.75. Healthcare is expensive and this company is not going out of business so I buy dips.\n\n-KWEB. +17.52%, $23.90. China will rebound, well at least Chinese tech. \n\n-Lmnd. +25.08%, $16.16. Saw a report on their business model and it gives headaches but can work if they survive the growing pains. I think they are here to stay and will probably get to $60 in the next 5 years.\n\n-Meta. +19.29%, $420. I actually bought Meta at $115 during the crazy but got spooked when it dropped below $110, I sold for a profit but kicked myself for not holding. I believe in the company and they are just getting started revenue wise in my opinion. So many AI plays here. Regretting not having the cash to load up this time around. \n\n-NFTY. +15.23%. $53.77. India will probably keep growing. This stock also pays a good dividend. \n\n-RBRK. +13.75. $30.83. Cybersecurity is growing. I also have positive numbers in Palo Alto which I buy on earnings drops\n\n-snap. +42.52%. $11.33. Snap is not going out of business. The stock drops after earnings so I just buy then and wait for a rebound. It’s one of my largest holdings. Wish I dumped more cash and wish it would drop when the market drops but it’s held firm the last few months\n\n-Z. +23.83%. $40.83. Bought during the sell off when the courts ruled against the industry. Zillow will be fine. \n\n\nI actually don’t have many losers. The stakes are small.\n\n-Aal. -14.41%. $12.54. I think it will bounce back in a year or two. \n\n-CGC. -15.33%. $7.52. I don’t know much about weed but figured I’d buy a small stake just in case.\n\n-MSOS. -14.19%. $8.70. Small stakes in weed, lottery ticket\n\n-WBD. -15.88%. $8.66. The worst buy I’ve made. Figured might as well keep it.\n\n-Snow. -13.67%. $154.53. I knew I was buying high with snowflake but didn’t expect the big drop. The stake is not big. I still do believe in the company.\n\n-Dis. -9.94%. $107.54. Knew I was buying high, my fault really. Thankfully not a big position and Disney will bounce back.\n\n-Hubs. -17.29%. $570.91. Tiny stake. I actually like the current price and will buy around $420.\n\n-CMG. -7.08%. $61.36. Knew I was buying high but long term hold.\n\n-PZZA. -7.84%. $45.74. One of my larger stakes. Papa John’s is at a 4-5 year low which is crazy to me since their numbers are not bad. It’s a cyclical play if you look at the chart. Plus the company is not going out of business. Worst case scenario is this drops to high $20s which do don’t know how that can even happen. I’ll keep buying weekly. ",

He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.\n\nThen Apple would be one of the search engine options when you first turn on your iPhone and the hope would be people would choose the Apple option over the Google option.\n\nWhat other options does Tim Cook have to replace the Google money?",

        "title": "🎭 \"Tariff Theater\": Why the 7% Rally Is a Mirage, Not a Market Rebound",
        "selftext": "The recent 7% rally in equities, coinciding with the Trump administration’s decision to roll back certain tariffs to 10%, has been interpreted by some as the beginning of a broader policy shift. In reality, the fundamental landscape remains unchanged. If anything, the superficial nature of the rollback only highlights the extent to which markets have latched onto optics in the absence of substantive improvement. This rally in equities has not been mirrored by the bond market.\n\nThe core dynamics of U.S. trade remain adversarial. China, the United States' largest goods supplier, continues to face high and sustained tariff exposure. The aggregate effective rate, factoring in prior rounds of reciprocal escalation, remains above 100% in several key categories. The European Union has not softened its stance, and in many areas, has reinforced its commitment to retaliatory measures. These are not temporary frictions; they are structural conflicts driven by divergent regulatory philosophies and increasingly protectionist trade regimes.\n\nThe administration’s trade team has pointed to limited agreements with smaller economies as signs of progress. But these are largely symbolic, wins on paper that have little bearing on global supply chains or multinational corporate strategy. For firms with cross-border exposure, especially in manufacturing, technology, and retail, the operating environment remains materially constrained. Cost structures have not normalized, logistics remain fragile, and geopolitical uncertainty continues to inhibit capital deployment.\n\nMultinational firms, Apple being a key example, have not seen operational relief. Their upstream suppliers are still entangled in the broader tariff gridlock, and downstream demand remains vulnerable to price transmission effects. Margins are thinning, and strategic flexibility is diminishing as firms are forced to hedge against policy volatility rather than invest into expansion.\n\nBeneath the surface, core macroeconomic indicators point to a deteriorating environment. Unemployment, while still moderate by historical standards, is trending upward. Real wage growth has stalled. Inflation, particularly in services and shelter, remains persistently elevated, even as headline CPI shows deceleration. Consumer credit delinquencies are rising. These are not the foundations of a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe current rally in equities is not being underwritten by earnings strength. On the contrary, forward guidance across several sectors has been revised downward, and earnings compression is visible in both nominal and real terms. What we are seeing in markets is not confidence, it is positioning. With liquidity abundant and volatility elevated, capital is rotating into risk on technicals, not fundamentals.\n\nTo complicate matters further, market behavior is beginning to resemble that of the late 1980s. Volatility is no longer episodic, it is persistent. The Federal Reserve’s posture remains hawkish, and the long end of the yield curve continues to rise, undermining equity valuations and tightening financial conditions in the real economy. At the same time, geopolitical dislocation is contributing to a growing perception that U.S. assets, once the global default for safe and productive capital, are no longer as insulated as they once were.\n\nForeign capital inflows are beginning to waver, and the strength of the dollar, long a source of stability, is now a headwind for export competitiveness. In this context, the idea that a marginal tariff adjustment constitutes a policy breakthrough is difficult to justify. If anything, it highlights how thin the narrative support for this rally truly is.\n\nUntil there is a credible de-escalation of trade tensions with China and the EU, a normalization of inflation and labor market conditions, and a return to earnings-led equity performance, the market remains structurally fragile. The recent rally is not a signal of recovery. It is a speculative drift, driven by hope, not data.\n\nInvestors would do well to treat it accordingly.",

They don’t want to eat them, so they’ll lower the price.”\n\nImplication:\n\nThe Trump administration expects the real burden of tariffs to fall on the small businesses themselves.\n\nUnspoken consequence:\n\nWhat Kevin Hassett did not mention is that the small business may go bankrupt, resulting in all of its employees being laid off.\n\nThese people are idiots..\n",

Forgive me if I spell something incorrectly, English is not my first language.\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4590406\n\nSo I read this paper about 100% Stock portfolios after watching a YouTube video on it (multiple out there).\n\nAnd I wondered how I’d go about choosing the stocks I’d invest in. I did so because just last year I didn’t touch stocks but when I went on my app on my iPhone (Stocks) and saw how much I could have made had I just invested in stocks that were already a big presence in almost all of my ETFs the. I’d have more value to my name.\n\nTo look at it I viewed an era that had large fluctuations in which I invested in which lead me to 2019 to 2024 because in-between that we had the fed-induced boom and the crash that came before that along with other crazy fluctuations.\n\nSo for my example I used march 2019 to March 2024 (which had steep decreases and increases):\n\n1.MSFT: 250.92% \n2.Apple: 248%\n3.Meta: 176.44%\n4.Googl: 149%\n5.Amazon: 96.46%\n\n1.QQQ: 140.45%\n2.VTI: 84.34%\n3.VOO: 81.39%\n4.VT: 54.38%\n\nHere is the Summary of percentages those sticks hold for each ETF:\n\n1. QQQ: ~41.3%\n2. VOO: ~22.2%\n3. VTI: ~13.0%\n4. VT: ~6.1%\n\n\nIt’s not like investing in Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon is unheard of, they already make a huge part of all ETFs you come across that measure commonly used domestic indexes. So… is this the way? I truly want your critique on this because if it works it works and if not then it doesn’t, it’s not about proving I’m right it’s about maximizing my understanding of investing. \n\n\n\nEdit: I think people misunderstood and I didn’t articulate it well either.

        "selftext": "In 2000 it was the internet, in the late 2000s we had the online shopping phase, 2010s FAANG stocks grew fast relative to the market, and in the past few years we have seen an AI boom, and a more recent quantum computing and space interest. I predict the next trend will be robotics. It is highly linked to AI, but hasn't seen any attention. As AI grows, robots will be implemented more into our daily lives, a process which will require robotics & robotic parts. Furthermore, these sectors can also have military applications, which will increase the eventual demand, and provides potential for further growth.\n\nHere are my speculative robotics stock picks, which have upside potential if the industry takes off. I included two volatile penny stocks and two stabler bets. I also included parts to show how much of each I would recommend in proportion to a total robotics portfolio, I will probably just invest $1000-$2000, with the specified allocations (maybe heavier on draganfly because I believe their company has a lot of upside potential and I have a high risk tolerance):\n\nDraganfly inc (2 parts): Canadian based, which means that if retaliatory tariffs are implemented they could still trade worldwide. They create drones & other software, for a variety of purposes: agriculture, military, energy, and public 'safety' (potentially surveillance). I predict robotics adoption in all these fields, which would bring success of the company. They have a decent board of directors, rated a strong buy by two analysts, and a low sh0rt interest, which hints a likely upside, and reduces potential of the company being driven to the ground that way. (Ticker: DPRO | $1.77 USD | 18.76M market cap.)\n\nIrobot corp (1 part): US based, make primarily robot vacuum cleaners. They have great revenue (about 6x market cap), so if they could manage a profit their share would do incredibly well. Their share is near 52 week lows. If they diversify into other robotics sectors, they could grow tremendously. I would place a conservative bet into this company, as them diversifying into other sectors would be a big if. (Ticker: IRBT | $2.79 USD | 86.78M market cap)\n\nTeradyne INC (3 parts): They make robots for various industries, including military and industrial. Tech could be used for civilian applications. (Ticker: TER | $81.27 USD | 13.04B market cap)\n\nRockwell automation (4 parts): They have 27 000 employees, and are already a large player in the robotics industry, yet they still have lots of room to grow. Established, profitable company with P/E ratio comparable to apple, and a dividend of about 1 percent. The reason NVIDIA stock grew is largely their AI hardware, and Rockwell does a lot of robotics hardware. (Ticker: ROK | $307.85 USD | $34.70B market cap)",

What truly concerns me is the long-term effect of excess liquidity. Inflation is brewing beneath the surface, and we’ll see its full impact in the years ahead. Over time, the velocity of money has declined while the money supply has surged, artificially propping up asset prices. My real fear isn’t a crash—it’s that inflation-adjusted returns will shrink to irrelevance.\n\nBonds are effectively useless. Stocks are outrageously priced, making it difficult to generate meaningful returns. This isn’t a market for investors—it’s a market for those looking to cash out. Genuine opportunities are scarce.\n\nIf inflation accelerates, cash will erode, bonds will remain dead weight, and overpriced stocks will have no room for growth. In the end, nobody wins.

        "selftext": "Early stages? Mid stages? Late stages?\n\nTech valuations are getting very rich, to their second-highest levels ever, even during the current 15+ year secular bull market (March 2009-present) marked by tech sector outperformance.\n\n- Apple: $3.6 trillion, 36x earnings\n\n- Microsoft: $3.5 trillion, 41x earnings\n\n- NVIDIA: $3.3 trillion, 79x earnings\n\nRight now, we’re still in a stage of the mania where simply saying “AI” is enough to make a stock rocket higher. Since unveiling Apple Intelligence on June 10, Apple stock has risen by 21% ($700 billion) on analyst predictions of an “upgrade supercycle.” Moderna stock shot up 60% higher in May after announcing a partnership with Open AI.\n\nEventually, this will give way to a “show me the money” phase in which investors need to see actual profits to sustain these valuations. But clearly we’re not there yet. For the companies selling shovels in the current gold rush (NVIDIA, TSMC, etc.) they’re generating spectacular earnings right now, but the question is how sustainable they’ll be for the longer term. Wall Street has their earnings growth priced in as being permanent.\n\nPossible turning points:\n\nApple will release its AI-enhanced iPhone 16 this autumn. If sales are weak, it’ll be clear that consumers aren’t as jazzed up about AI as markets are predicting. But the last few years haven’t had any notable upgrades at all, so there could still be an upgrade cycle.\n\nOn the corporate side, it’s harder to predict. Corporations including financial services & other non-tech industries have been willing to pay Microsoft & Open AI hand over fist because it’s the latest hot technology; mentioning AI boosts their stock prices; and they’re always looking for ways to boost efficiency.\n\nFor Big Tech, there’s a widespread belief that this is a can’t-fail arms race, given the winner-takes-all nature of the industry. Therefore, it’s possible that even if consumers aren’t too hyped about AI, Big Tech corporations will gladly continue to pay NVIDIA billions every year. Especially since M&A has grinded to a halt due to regulatory scrutiny, they have to find something to do with all this money.\n\nCentral banks:\n\nOn top of all this, you have central banks around the world itching to ease and pump markets higher. Alan Greenspan’s 1995 rate cuts likely extended the life of the first Internet bubble by a few years. But at least he recognized it was a bubble and popped it in 2000 by raising rates, even as inflation was below-target & decelerating. Jerome Powell, who’s worth over $50 million and highly invested in stocks, has said he’d do no such thing, and only high inflation can lead to more rate hikes.\n\n—\n\nWhat are your thoughts? How high will the market & tech valuations go? Will this lead to a market crash or a new plateau?\n\n",

Plus a massive cash position, well over $100 billion.\n\nSo how do you value that?\n\nFirst, I look at **book value**. Historically, Berkshire trades around 1.3 to 1.5 times book. But with interest rates rising and market multiples normalizing, that should compress.\n\nWarren Buffett himself has said he would buy back shares at **1.2 times book value or below** if he believes the stock is trading below intrinsic value. That is a pretty strong signal, and it gives us a decent benchmark.\n\nSecond, I look at **earnings power**. Between its operating businesses and its investment portfolio, Berkshire is still a cash machine. But it is no longer a 20 percent compounding machine like it was in its early days. The law of large numbers applies here.\n\nIf I had to name a number today, I would start getting interested around that 1.2x book value range. Maybe lower depending on how the macro looks.

I'm expecting to hear people say just buy SPY but please try to relate to my findings. ",

        "title": "Are we heading into another lost decade?",
        "selftext": "In my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j9ygro/remembering_stock_market_crash_of_2022/), I argued that periods of fear during market corrections are often exaggerated and that markets generally recover over time. This sparked a lot of discussion, with valid concerns that this time might actually be different. Interest rates are high. Stock prices seem expensive. There’s talk of recession, tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty, and massive government debt. Investors are rightly asking: **Are we heading for a lost decade?**\n\nSo I did some research and sharing my conclusion below. This is based on my understanding, and would appreciate feedback and different perspectives.\n\nFor most investors, the thought of spending ten years in a market that goes nowhere is unsettling. But it's entirely possible and has happened before multiple times. Certain eras in market history earned the nickname “lost decade” because stock prices failed to sustainably recover for 10 years or more. The most notable and often cited examples are:\n\n* **Great Depression of 1929:** Stocks collapsed nearly 90%, and the economy fell apart. The market didn’t recover for decades. It took massive government spending during World War II to reignite growth.\n* **The Stagflation ‘70s:** Inflation soared past 14%, oil shocks rocked the global economy, and interest rates were pushed up to 20%. The result? Stocks barely moved for a decade, losing purchasing power to inflation.\n* **The Dot-Com Bust & Financial Crisis (2000-2010):** First, the dot-com bubble popped, wiping out overvalued tech stocks. Then, just as the market started recovering, the 2008 financial crisis hit, dragging the economy into a deep recession. It took more than a decade for markets to fully recover.\n* **Japan’s Lost Decades (1989-Present):** The worst example of all. In the late 1980s, Japan was the hottest economy in the world—until a massive asset bubble popped. Stocks crashed, real estate values collapsed, and economic growth never fully returned. More than 30 years later, Japan’s stock market has just begun to surpass it’s all time high reached in 1989.\n\n# While these periods had different triggers and circumstances, they all shared a few common characteristics:\n\n1. **High stock market valuations at the start.** When investors pay too much for stocks, future returns tend to be disappointing, even if the economy grows.\n2. **Debt was excessive.** Whether it was households, corporations, or governments, excessive borrowing created major financial drag.\n3. **Big economic disruptions followed.** Inflation in the ‘70s, a financial system breakdown in the 2000s, and deflation in Japan—each one created a decade of stagnation\n4. **Government responses often made things worse.** Central banks and policymakers either moved too slowly or responded in ways that prolonged economic pain.\n5. **Long-term structural drags slowed recoveries.** Aging populations, slowing workforce growth, and weak productivity made it harder for economies to bounce back.\n\n**Now, let’s compare that to today.**\n\n* **Stock market valuations are high, but not in bubble territory.** The S&P 500’s valuation is elevated, much like before the 2000s lost decade. The current Schiller P/E ratio (price to cyclically adjusted earnings) is well above the historical average. But today’s leading companies—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta —are highly profitable and are driving real earnings growth, unlike the speculative tech stocks of 2000.\n* **Inflation is cooling but remains higher than ideal.** Unlike the 1970s, where inflation spiraled out of control going as high as 14%, today’s price pressures are slowly easing and much more moderate (2.8% as per latest inflation report). Supply chains are improving, and AI-driven productivity gains could help keep costs in check.\n* **Debt is a major concern—but it’s not as out of control.** U.S. government debt is at record levels, limiting future stimulus options. But unlike 2008, household and corporate debt are under control. Banks are better capitalized, and there’s no widespread financial system breakdown looming.\n* **Geopolitical risks are real, but markets have absorbed them so far.** Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, ongoing wars, and the shift toward deglobalization continue to be key risks.\n* **Demographics are a mixed bag.** The U.S. workforce is aging (Avg age. 39), but still younger than Japan during early 2000s (Avg age 48). Immigration and higher workforce participation rates still give the economy more resilience than Japan or Europe.\n* **The biggest wildcard is AI and automation.** A hopeful difference today is the pace of technological innovation. The late 1920s had new tech (radio, automobiles) but the Depression cut investment in them. The 1970s paradoxically saw relatively slow productivity growth (despite the IT revolution being on the horizon, its benefits weren’t felt until the 1980s–90s). Today, we’re on the cusp of another tech-driven productivity boom – chiefly due to artificial intelligence and automation. If AI can boost efficiency significantly, it could raise economic growth in the latter part of this decade. Goldman Sachs predicts generative AI could eventually lift GDP by \\~7% over a decade. Such a boost would be a stark difference from past lost decades, which generally lacked a positive productivity shock to offset their drags. Right now a lot of it seems hype. But if AI delivers on its promise without displacing jobs at large scale, it can lead to an unprecedented boom and a period of huge wealth creation.\n\n**So while there are risks, this is not the same setup as past lost decades.**\n\nWhile history never repeats exactly, it does rhyme. Today we see echoes of past pre-crisis extremes – high stock valuations and heavy debts – combined with new challenges like aging demographics and geopolitical shifts. **However, we also see crucial differences: inflation is being actively managed (not runaway as in the ’70s), our financial system (banks and corporates) is more robust than before the 2008 crisis, and potential growth drivers (AI, etc.) could emerge to surprise on the upside**.\n\nInstead of lost decade, **we appear to be headed towards a muddled decade** — some ups, some downs, growth in some specific sectors, and at least some modest growth, even if lower than previous decade.\n\nOf course, this can change as events play out in the world in coming months and years. There may be major natural disasters that disrupt global supply chains or something else. But as things stand now, the more probable outcome is a decade of lower returns than previous decade rather than complete stagnation.\n\n**What does it mean for you?** Investors who expect 10-12% annual returns just through index investing, like in the 2010s, may be disappointed. But those who adapt—focusing on quality companies, dividends, and emerging growth areas like AI—could still emerge out wealthier and stronger.",

        "title": "Bitcoin Isn’t Unique But Infinite—$100K Is Beyond Absurd",
        "selftext": "Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it’s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, “Only 21 million bottles will ever exist.” They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.\n\nBut here’s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn’t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it’s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.\n\nThink about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system—one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants—to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing—they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin’s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.\n\nThis brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.\n\nStocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.\n\nFiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers—companies, governments, or individuals—to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.\n\nCryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing—no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.\n\nBitcoin’s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, “We’re only producing 21 million bottles.” The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.\n\nThe absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.\n\nBitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin’s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin’s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren’t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they’re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.\n\nThis speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.\n\nBitcoin isn’t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It’s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.\n\nWhen the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin’s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",
