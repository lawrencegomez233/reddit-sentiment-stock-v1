Apple's imports into the U.S. have so far escaped being hit since the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers and some other consumer electronic devices from \"reciprocal\" tariffs imposed in early April. \n\nApple shares dropped 3% on Friday to around $195, losing ground for the eighth consecutive session. The stock has lost 22% of its value since the start of 2025, significantly lagging the performance of its Magnificent Seven peers, as sentiment toward the company has soured due to its significant exposure to tariffs\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Apple’s chart and use technical analysis identify major price levels worth watching out for.\n\n**Descending Broadening Formation in Play**\n\nSince setting their record high in late December, Apple shares have trended lower within a descending broadening formation, with the price tagging the pattern’s upper and lower trendline on several occasions since that time.\n\nMore recently, the stock ran into selling pressure near the pattern’s upper trendline and 50-day moving average, which has coincided with the relative strength index falling below its neutral threshold to signal weakening price momentum.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that the 50-day MA crossed below the 200-day MA in early April to form a \"death cross,\" a chart signal that indicates further declines.\n\nLet’s point out major support and resistance levels on Apple’s chart that investors will likely be watching.\n\n**Major Support Levels to Watch**\n\nFurther weakness from current levels could see the shares initially fall to around $193. The price may encounter support near this month’s low, which closely aligns with a narrow consolidation period that formed on the chart in the back half of May last year.\n\nThe bulls’ failure to successfully defend this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $169. Investors may seek buy-and-hold entry points in this location near April's prominent low and a brief period of sideways drift before the last May’s stock gap above the 200-day MA.\n\n**Crucial Resistance Levels to Monitor**\n\nUpswings in the stock could see the price initially climb toward $215. This area may provide overhead selling pressure near a trendline that links a range of corresponding peaks and troughs on the chart stretching back to June last year.\n\nFinally, a more-bullish move in Apple shares could fuel a rally to around $237. Investors who bought at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region where notable peaks developed on the chart last July and October.",

Macs: Relied on Intel from 2006-2020, now transitioning to their own M-series (Apple Silicon).\n\nMy theory? Apple's following a familiar playbook:\n\n1. Integrate existing AI tech (OpenAI)\n2. Develop in-house models in parallel\n3. Eventually phase out external AI for proprietary solutions\n\nThese in-house AI models would likely be optimized for Apple's custom chips, just like their current software. This could give them a significant edge in performance and efficiency.\n\nApple's success often comes from perfecting technologies rather than being first.

This likely underestimates since they reliably beat estimates (especially Nvidia).\n- I plotted all the companies on the same vertical scale so that we could directly compare differences in their earnings.\n- At $34.4B (likely generous since it excludes much of the early period when Tesla was not profitable), Tesla has generated less cumulative net income than Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia did in the last two quarters alone. I knew about the first three, but not the latter three. Moreover, it less net income in its entire corporate lifespan than Apple did **in last quarter alone**, in what was generally viewed as a disappointing quarter for Apple.\n- The lead with which Apple has over the rest of the field is remarkable, although the overall trend appears flat. But I didn't appreciate the very strong seasonal trend with each release cycle leading into the holiday season.\n- Alphabet actually takes the lead for the last year, topping $100 billion in net income.\n- I was surprised to learn that despite a late start, Meta has actually made more money cumulatively than Amazon.\n",

        "selftext": "First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from May. 16 to May. 23. \n\nMidweek, the main focus was 30-year Treasury yield. By the end of the week, Trump took center stage with a proposal for 50% tariff on European Union starting June 1. While Scott Bessent provided some optimism, Fed's Goolsbee added a dose of negative. Let's take a look at the current positions.\n\nHere are the S&P 500's week-by-week results,\n\nMar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Apr. 4 close at 5,074.08 🔴\n\nApr. 4 close at 5,074.08 - Apr. 11 close at 5,358.75 🟢\n\nApr. 11 close at 5,358.75 - Apr. 25 close at 5,523.52 🟢\n\nApr. 25 close at 5,358.75 - May. 2 close at 5,686.67 🟢\n\nMay. 2 close at 5,686.67 - May. 9 close at 5,659.91 🔴\n\nMay. 9 close at 5,659.91 - May. 16 close at 5,957.63 🟢 (+5.26%)\n\nMay. 16 close at 5,957.63 - May. 23 close at 5,802.82 🔴 (-2.59%)\n\nDay-by-Day Standouts;\n\n🔸 Monday: Last week ended very well with the S&P 500 gained more than 5%. This week started with downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Moody's and causing indexes open more than 1% lower. Despite the initial panic, markets recovered during the session and closed slightly higher. 🟢\n\n🔸 Tuesday: After a strong recovery on Monday, the indexes opened flat on Tuesday. The market began to focus on the 30-year Treasury yield. It was a quiet session and the S&P 500 closed slightly lower. Meanwhile, investors turned to gold as a safe haven and pushing price up around 2% to $3,300. 🔴\n\n🔸 Wednesday: Before the session, CNN reported that Israel may attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Gold prices rose again and passed $3,300. The stock market opened lower around 0.5% due to both 30-year Treasury yield and Israel attack. During the session, 30-year Treasury yield continued upper trend and back above 5.05%. It's highest level since October 2023. The stock market closed lower more than 1.5%. This is also the worst close so far in May. 🔴\n\n🔸 Thursday: After 2-day losing streak, the stock market opened flat. The 30-year Treasury yield hit 5.15% before easing. The House of Representatives passed Trump’s tax and spending bill. As a result, the S&P 500 closed slightly negative and down just 0.04% while the Nasdaq finished higher. 🔴\n\n🔸 Friday: Yesterday was a busy day. Before the session, Trump proposed a 50% tariff on European Union starting June 1. The future market reacted immediately and dropping more than 1%. He also stated that Apple should move production to the U.S. and he can add 25% tariff on them. The stock market opened lower more than 1%. During the session, Scott Bessent offered some optimism. He said several large trade deals will be announced in the next couple of weeks and the U.S. will resume in-person negotiations with China. This helped the market recover slightly, but the S&P 500 still closed lower more than 0.5% and extending losing streak to 4-day. Additionally, Fed's Goolsbee said that rate cuts are still possible in next 10-16 months due to uncertainty in trade policy. As of now, the stock market expects the earlist in September. 🔴\n\nTrump has remained silent on tariffs for a week and the stock market has been trending upward. On April 7, the S&P 500 hit the lowest level at 4,835.04 and then it had climbed at 5,968.61 on May 19. It gained over 20% in just a month. Despite recent volatility, the stock market hasn't dropped significantly. Could this mean it's still looking to forward? What do you think? And how was your week?\n\n❓ Note: Many people have asked where screenshots come from in my previous posts. I'm using Stock+ on iPhone and iPad. You can find it on the App Store.

The sudden buying binge could cause an “artificially high” level of economic activity, said Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President [Austan Goolsbee](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/chicago-fed-president-goolsbee-sees-rate-cuts-depending-on-inflation-progress.html).\n\n“That kind of preemptive purchasing is probably even more pronounced on the business side,” Goolsbee told CBS’ “Face The Nation” on Sunday, adding: “We heard a lot about preemptive building-up of inventories that could last 60 days, 90 days, if there \\[was\\] going to be more uncertainty.”\n\nBusinesses stockpiling inventory and [consumers accelerating their purchasing decisions](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/20/back-market-ceo-trump-tariffs-give-americans-chance-to-change-habits.html) — buying an [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) iPhone now, say, rather than waiting until the fall — may inflate U.S. economic activity in April and lead to a slowdown in the coming months, Goolsbee suggested.\n\n“Activity might look artificially high in the initial, and then by the summer, might fall off — because people have bought it all,” he said.\n\nSectors affected by Trump’s tariffs, particularly the auto industry, are most likely to heavily stock up on inventory now before import levies on goods from other countries potentially rise further, said Goolsbee. Many car parts, electronic components and other big-ticket consumer items are manufactured in China, for example, which currently faces a 145% total tariff rate on goods imported to the United States.\n\n[Trump’s tariffs on a bevy of other countries](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariffs-us-businesses-are-angry-worried-about-survival-price-hikes.html) are currently in the middle of a 90-day pause, with a 10% baseline tariff rate instead applying to all imported goods across the board. The pause is due to expire on July 9, with [Trump touting a series of rate negotiations](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/09/trump-announces-90-day-tariff-pause-for-at-least-some-countries.html) with foreign leaders between now and then.\n\n“We don’t know, 90 days from now, when they’ve revisited the tariffs, we don’t know how big they’re going to be,” Goolsbee said.\n\nSome U.S. business owners who buy goods manufactured in China say they already can’t afford to place rush orders on inventory. Matt Rollens, owner and CEO of Granite Bay, California-based novelty drinkware company Dragon Glassware, [says he’s temporarily holding his products in China](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/ceo-trump-china-tariffs-are-doomsday-scenario-for-small-businesses.html) because paying the 145% levy would force him to raise consumer prices by at least 50%, likely drying up customer demand.\n\nRollens has enough inventory in the U.S. to last roughly until June, and hopes the tariffs will be rolled back by then, he told CNBC Make It on April 11.\n\nShort-term uncertainty and financial pain aside, the Fed’s Goolsbee expressed optimism about the country’s longer-term economic outlook.\n\n“If we can get through this, it’s important to remember: The hard data coming into April was pretty good. The unemployment rate \\[was\\] around steady full employment, inflation \\[was\\] coming down,” he said. “It’s just a desire of people expressing they don’t want to back to ’21 and ’22, at a time when inflation was really raging out of control.”",

That highlighted the way the Trump administration’s tariffs campaign — peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods — is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.\n\nInvestors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.’s artificial intelligence chips.\n\nLast year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.\n\nThe value of phone component exports to India — home to Apple’s biggest iPhone production base outside of China — roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.\n\nApple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home. The device has never been produced in the US, a project that appears unfeasible at least in the short run.",

The iPhone 16 would climb to $959 from $799.\n\nHere is what the major phone carriers said this week as they reported earnings about the potential for tariff-driven price increases on consumers.\n\n# Verizon ([VZ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VZ)) CEO Hans Vestberg:\n\n\"In general, if the tariff is going to be as high as they say on the handsets, we are not planning to cover that in our work,\" Vestberg said. \"That's just not going to be possible. So, we will continue to be financially disciplined in whatever promotions we have, but we will not cover any enormous increase on tariffs on handsets. That's ultimately going to hit the consumer in the market. But again, it's too early to say. We don't know where tariff is going to go.\"\n\n# AT&T ([T](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/T)) CEO John Stankey:\n\n\"So if tariffs are the next driver of an increase in the unit cost of handsets, I imagine we're going to have to go through the exact same play, which is, first of all, understand what the customer needs and then make some adjustments to how we support them in that process,\" Stankey said. \"But that process is going to be taking that cost as we've traditionally done and largely moving it through to the end user and fitting it into the business model of ultimately what we can afford to drive the right level of returns in our business. And I think we've demonstrated over time that we've done that fairly effectively.\"\n\n# T-Mobile ([TMUS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TMUS)) CEO Mike Sievert to [Yahoo Finance ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-ceo-tariffs-on-phones-will-have-to-be-eaten-by-consumers-231011987.html)(video above):\n\n\"Tariffs are unpredictable at this point,\" Sievert said. \"Obviously, we're watching closely. If they come in and they're significant in some way, that's going to have to be borne by the customer. I mean, our model isn't prepared for something like that.\"\n\nSievert added, \"I think what would happen is prices will rise for smartphones, and then people will slow down their purchases of smartphones, and upgrade rates will slow. Those would be the dynamics that would happen. We don't see that that is on the way.\"",

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nWe've had a minor bounce today from the multiple country individual panics on Monday, so today is mainly focused on finding stocks that have bounced that haven't bounced too strongly yet compared to others (mainly due to the exposure to tariffs they have compared to other companies).\n\nTickers are ordered from most risk and exposure to tariffs to least. **The next big catalyst I'm waiting for is an actual tariff response with numbers from China (because they haven't given firm numbers beyond vowing retaliation)**\n\nNews: [US Stock Futures Rise As Dip Buyers Emerge After Selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/us-stock-futures-rise-as-dip-buyers-emerge-after-selloff)\n\n[**BABA (BABA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)/JD/FXI/other Chinese companies- China hasn't budged on the tariffs at all and signaled that they are going to \"fight until the end\" after Trump threatens 50% additional tariffs.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- Mainly looking at this due to AAPL being the most exposed of the MAG7 due to iPhones accounting for \\~50% of the company's revenue, we're 20% down from pre-tariff announcements, arguably this is one of my favorite candidates once we DO resolve tariffs to turn. \n\n[**CAT (Caterpillar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CAT&p=d)/[**SWK (Stanley Black & Decker)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWK&p=d)\\- Industry overlap in tools/equipment and having major manufacturing in China, CAT has far more exposure in China and is also arguably a more defensive stock despite being in line with housing/other infrastructure spending. (but also note that we're only 10% down from pre-tariff prices)\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- Something that surprised me was the strength of NVDA selling off (I know that input costs will be the reason for inevitable rise in costs, despite Taiwanese chips being exempt from tariffs).

Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.\n\nContext: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.\n\nRisks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in SouthEast Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.\n\nRelated Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks.\n\nOffhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META)\n\nTicker: ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dh5rkli99cge1.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=acb81ac92f0567332dd437609f2551796713215d\n\nCatalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.\n\nIt leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.\n\nKerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.\n\nThe report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.\n\nContext: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.\n\nSector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.\n\nKerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.\n\nChina's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.\n\nRisks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now.\n\nHowever, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result.\n\nThere are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.\n\nRelated Tickers: LRCX, AMAT, KLAC\n\nTicker: INTC\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ug6evzz99cge1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec9e7355a1ce06f1b75734263d3e5454c61ee31\n\nCatalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.\n\nContext: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.\n\nIntel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.\n\nRisks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.\n\nRelated Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM\n\nTicker: ASTS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvcyyufa9cge1.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=a65d27f263bff96fbbd2dd41abca36e0d42a073a\n\nCatalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States.

It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips- it pushes companies to be more incentivized to rent for the short term.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29i57yvsdmse1.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd68618f5cf96b46c2325e6b14ff787ccc40504\n\n[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected.

        "title": "WSJ—Trump’s Economic Messaging is Spooking Some of His Own Advisers👀",
        "selftext": "WSJ—President Trump’s stop-and-start trade policy and uneven economic messaging have rattled some of his own allies, triggering a flood of calls from business executives, concerns from Republican lawmakers and tension in the White House.\n\nSenior officials, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, have received panicked calls from chief executives and lobbyists, who have urged the administration to calm jittery markets by outlining a more predictable tariff agenda, according to people familiar with the discussions. Many in the business community have abandoned efforts to get the president to reverse course on trade, instead pleading with the White House for clarity on his approach, the people said. \n\nIn a meeting Monday in the White House’s Roosevelt Room, the president and his top advisers huddled with the chief executive officers of International Business Machines, Qualcomm, HP and other tech companies. Some of the CEOs voiced their concerns about Trump’s tariffs, warning that they could hurt their industry, according to a person who attended the meeting. Trump told reporters that attendees at the meeting talked about investing in the U.S.\n\nThe mixed messages from the president and his advisers have raised concerns among some Republicans that Trump lacks a cohesive economic plan. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week the economy needed a “detox.” Trump has acknowledged that the tariffs could result in economic pain for consumers and, in an interview Sunday, declined to rule out a recession, accelerating a selloff on Wall Street on Monday that wiped out all gains in major stock indexes since Election Day in November. On Tuesday, the president played down the possibility of a recession, but underscored his commitment to far-reaching tariffs. \n\nAll the while, Trump and his team have made frequent adjustments to his trade policies, announcing last-minute exemptions and reversals.\n\n“It has been a horrific start for the economic policy team,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director who now runs the conservative American Action Forum.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to tariffs has unnerved some Trump administration economic officials, including staff on the National Economic Council, who are concerned that tariffs and uncertainty over trade policy are tanking the stock market and fueling price increases on everything from energy to construction materials, people familiar with the matter said. The president’s economic advisers have warned him that tariffs could hurt the market and economic growth, but he has largely been undeterred, the people said. \n\nThe White House said Trump’s economic advisers aren’t divided. “Every member of the Trump administration is playing from the same playbook—President Trump’s playbook—to enact an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said. \n\nDesai confirmed that senior officials have taken calls from corporate leaders, adding that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has talked to nearly a dozen CEOs in the past two days.\n\nThe spate of tariff proclamations and the resulting economic convulsions have brought to the surface long-simmering tensions among members of Trump’s economic team.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the hard-charging former chief executive at the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, is overseeing Trump’s expansive trade agenda and has regularly appeared on cable television to discuss the matter. He has at times not fully looped in some of the president’s other economic advisers, according to people familiar with the matter, including Hassett, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and officials at the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nIn one instance last week, Lutnick went on Fox News and announced that Canada and Mexico could soon strike a deal with the U.S. to avoid some of the 25% tariffs Trump had imposed over fentanyl trafficking. That surprised Greer and CEA staff, leaving them rushing to come up with a solution, eventually persuading Trump to grant a one-month pause on tariffs for goods that comply with a U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBessent has made clear to members of Trump’s team that he wants to be a principal voice on economic policy across the administration, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n“Secretary Lutnick’s long and immensely successful private sector career makes him an integral addition to the Trump administration’s trade and economic team,” Desai said, pointing to manufacturing job gains and investment commitments from companies such as Apple   and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  \n\nOn CBS News on Tuesday night, Lutnick defended the administration’s rollout of its trade policy, saying: “It is not chaotic, and the only one who thinks it’s chaotic is someone who’s being silly.”\n\nNearly two months into Trump’s presidency, his advisers say he is more determined than ever to carry out his far-reaching tariff agenda, despite increasing pressure to change course. \n\nIn Trump’s first term, he watched the markets almost hourly, and even a temporary dip could lead to a change in policy, former senior administration officials said. This time, he is still interested in the markets, but is less inclined to abandon his tariff plans, though he has delayed the implementation of some duties, an administration official said. \n\nTrump’s first-term National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, and others at times opposed the president’s tariff proposals. This time, most of Trump’s current advisers aren’t trying to dissuade him from invoking tariffs, officials said. Instead, they are advocating for more targeted tariffs with exemptions for key sectors. \n\nFor example, Hassett and others successfully lobbied Trump to abandon his campaign pledge for an across-the-board tariff on all U.S. trading partners, and to opt instead for a reciprocal trade action that would allow room for other nations to negotiate lower tariffs with the U.S., according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nTrump’s reciprocal tariff move, which seeks to equalize U.S. tariffs with the duties and nontariff barriers charged by other nations, is set to be announced in April. But that initiative could take six months or more to implement fully, people familiar with the policy previously told The Wall Street Journal. \n\nThe uncertainty over tariff policy is also frustrating some Trump allies on Capitol Hill, a growing number of whom are worried about the economic ramifications of tariffs.\n\n“We don’t know what this is gonna look like tomorrow,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.), adding that he is “very frustrated” by the uncertainty that the tariff agenda is foisting on farmers and businesses in his state. \n\nRepublican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said the stop-and-start nature of the tariffs is contributing to stock market losses and difficulties in corporate planning. “Business hates uncertainty,” he said.\n\nSen. Bill Hagerty (R., Tenn.), a Trump confidant and a first-term ambassador to Japan, acknowledged that the markets are “trying to digest” the messages emanating from the White House on tariffs, but held out hope that certainty could be on the horizon.\n\n“I think once we get these [tariff] announcements done and the market can actually sort out exactly what they mean, that will hopefully calm things,” he said.\n\nTrump spoke Tuesday to the Business Roundtable, an influential group of corporate executives. A person familiar with the event’s planning said several executives changed their plans to attend.\n\n“Swinging from one extreme to another is not the right policy approach,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told an energy conference in Houston on Monday. “We have allocated capital that’s out there for decades, and so we really need consistent and durable policy.”\n",
