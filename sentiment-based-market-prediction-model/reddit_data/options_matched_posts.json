        "title": "**LAST MINUTE MONEY MOVE** Options Plays for AAPL Earnings and Beyond",
        "selftext": "LAST MINUTE OPTION PLAYS FOR AAPL EARNINGS AND BEYOND\n\n \n\nContinuing our eventful week of earnings and government reports, another great opportunity for investors comes from Apple. Personally, it is so difficult to tell which way the underlying will move, as Apple is one of the strongest and best companies in the world(heck just about everyone I know has at least some type of Apple product), but with economic uncertainty in the US and risk of costs drastically rising from tariffs, its impossible to know what will happen. That being said, we still came up with the best options strategies for whichever way it moves, and this could be the opportunity YOU have been looking for.\n\nOur goals were to limit downside risk, maximize potential profits(duh), and be in the money as soon as possible, rather than finding a trade that is only profitable near expiration. On this note, for you bulls out there, the first trade we found is a 250/270 Call Spread, expiring in June\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29lfp9wvd7ye1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5ad8032fb1911455083281c0ba40d582843641e\n\nThe cost of this trade is slightly higher than average over the past two years, but well cheaper than it’s been over the past month and a half, which I believe gives it quite good value\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/opkhip3xd7ye1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=c00260cd72d206184bb86899e4b947069dbe2b8d\n\nSimilarly to many of the leading US equities, the cost of the underlying is high compared to the past couple years, but also well below its recent February high. The implications of this are for each investor to determine themselves, but there is a case to be made for movement in either direction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itki5a9yd7ye1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5f7857e65314e158b8996c473f8592790150b5\n\nThe heatmap of this trade shows the profitability probabilities, and we like this trade because it profits immediately on a positive movement in the underlying, while limiting downside risk to the cost of the premium only, making it a safe trade with the chance for very strong returns.\n\n\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pntbuqwzd7ye1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=c144f3ad663a7b675e6db96a7177d9ed8b2cee12\n\nOn this flip side, for you bears out there looking to profit on a downward move, we found a 185/165 Put Spread, also expiring in June\n\n\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvab5uy0e7ye1.png?width=3035&format=png&auto=webp&s=860af779a14bb5d7dfacbeecfc6c8aaf05f71ecb\n\nThe cost of this trade is similar top the positive one, in the sense that it is slightly higher than it was historically, but also cheaper than it’s been over the past few weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0prq7ra2e7ye1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=6afa7f8ad836f4b9496ed81b2507c0885fa9682a\n\nThe heatmap of this trade shows the strong profitability of this trade, showing how it profits immediately upon a downward move of the underlying, while at the same showing how risk is limited to the cost of the premium, giving it a high return chance with minimal negative risk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grhbdi85e7ye1.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9975e124b91f9fb972e1e03fc59a0eb58af04c6\n\nIn conclusion, this is a time of uncertainty in the US and global markets. This creates opportunities for investors to capitalize on volatility and make serious money. While I do not have a crystal ball and cannot say which direction AAPL or any stock will move, we can and do provide the best trades to make for each side and leave it up to you.\n\n \n\nAnd remember, at the end of the day, it’s better to be lucky than good, so good luck to you all.",

Revenue killer  \n❌ **China market shrinking** – Losing ground to local brands (Huawei, Xiaomi). iPhone = AAPL’s cash cow.

Which again is not for Apple is not crazy.  \n  \n  \nEven with Price decay.

This is not an accident or luck, it's becoming increasingly more consistent as gain more experience with double calendars.\n\nI'm just a hair from 30% on the year, the market has experienced its worst drawdown and am totally unexposed and still profiting it's an amazing and beautiful thing to see.\n\n* Three weeks ago was very profitable with NFLX $650/$715 double calendar and TSM $165/$185/$205 triple calendar. However, bought NVDA shares impulsively at the top, options gains covered the losses cutting even. Vowed to never have undefined risk again. Only traded options since, no shares anymore and won't buy shares unless it's an ETF. Am ready to go deep on SMH after see fear and greed index tank to 20's.\n* Two weeks ago was profitable on 3/4 companies played through earning's. Made post detailing the mistake made, bought triple calendar $170 (1), $185 (3), $200 (4) on Google but did not create a neutral structure. There was not enough downside protection, only had (1) put calendar compared to (4) calendars OTM and (3) ATM. Vowed to always play the market neutrally and prepare equally for the downside always.\n\nThis week was profitable on every company or 5/5, last week going 3/4 with the Google mistake being something recognized early, but didn't correct and would've been very profitable going 4/4 had bought more put calendars and offset the ATM and OTM call calendars.\n\nThis week played (ON $64/$76), (Meta $455/$510), (Apple $205/$217.5/$230), (Amzn $165/$180/$195), (Dkng $32/$40)\n\nMost of the contracts like to close before earning's to secure profit, offset the cost/risk of what I do hold through earning's. I also use the ATM calendar as the new bottom or top if price has moved too aggressively. For example, I had meta $400/$455/$500 originally but the price over few days ran from $455 to $475. So right before earning's I closed the $400/$500. I used the $455 as the floor, opening the $510 as the new top so $455/$510 instead to carry through earning's. Have to adapt.\n\nImo nobody can become consistently profitable without playing to the upside and downside, this is why neutral structures like double calendars are so effective, more-so during earning's when high IV environment gives massive premiums offsetting the cost of the calls/puts so playing direction on a mulligan. The ultimate Theta play imo.\n\n(Next week have LLY $730/$795/$870, DDOG $90/$125, ELF $135/$185,  - Need companies to report later in the week so can close before earning's, right before expiration, giving Theta time to burn up to the last moment possible, giving the market no time to react to earning's; the following days always dangerous. For example, Meta much harder to play than Amazon, difference of reporting Wednesday close vs. Thursday close. If wanted to be a gambler could hold all my contracts through earning's. but I want to sell and keep what I hold through basically for free from the profit of closing before, which really has cost me profit but am more concerned about averting risk.)",

        "title": "Technical Indicators to Detect Short-Term Price Increases for Options Trading",
        "selftext": "**Note: This is an updated version of a previous post that was removed as it wasn't sufficiently related to options trading; Mods, please let me know if this post is still not adequate**\n\nHello all!\n\nI'm posting here again relating to technique I've started using which I'm hoping will be rather profitable in options trading. The technique I use relies on 3 technical indicators to predict short-term (12 - 24 hours post-signal) increases in the market; while the increases can vary considerably, you can consistently rely on a $1 - $2 jump in the price for most liquid stocks (that are above $100/share), which should be able to generate a profit a good chunk of the time.\n\n# The Strategy\n\nThe technical indicators (and filters) I rely on are:\n\n* **200 MA**: The price must be above the 200 MA\n* **Stochastic RSI**: A built in indicator on tradingview where sub-20 indicates oversold conditions; two conditions must be met here\n   * The indicator (K) must dip below 20 at some point\n   * The difference between the fast (K) and the slow (D) must be greater than or equal to 5\n* **The Ensemble Technical Indicator** **(ETI)**: The ETI is an indicator I created (which is available on Tradingview) which converts numerous technical indicators into 1 or -1 (based on whether the trend is bullish or bearish for that specific indicator), sums these numbers up and then sums across the previous 20 value to generate a singular value. Here values under -40 indicate oversold while those over 50 indicate overbought. For more details relating to this indicator, you can refer to a post I made in the technical indicator subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalanalysis/comments/1fc1kln/the_ensemble_technical_indicator_a_new_technical/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The indicator must dip at or below -40 for this strategy.\n\nSo, to summarize, for a buy signal the price has to be **above** the 200 MA, with the Stochastic RSI **dipping below** 20 **while** the ETI is at-40 or below, **and** the difference between the K and D metrics of the Stochastic RSI must be **5 or more**.\n\nThat's a mouthful! But it's quite easy to spot on a chart (I chose AMZN as I'm monitoring the chart right now), which I've pasted below. The candles are at the 4 hour level as this (and the 1D) level tends to have a higher success rate than lower timeframes (1 hr can also be used for more frequent signals)\n\n[AMZN chart on Tradingview](https://preview.redd.it/h4xh4is7elde1.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=54db642ff824c00f8145e77d8bb97f086667044b)\n\nSo we can see that on Monday November 25th at 9:30a, all our criteria have been satisfied:\n\n* Price is above 200MA\n* ETI is at/below -40 (-44)\n* Stoch RSI has dipped below 20 while ETI is at/below -40\n* The difference between the K (blue line) and D (orange line) is equal to or greater than 5 (6.59)\n\nAs such we would buy an ATM option at the next open ($201.90).\n\nThere can be some slightly ambiguous circumstances, which IMO fulfil the criteria I laid out, but are not as obvious. For instance, below we see the difference between the K & D is greater than 5, but the K is above 20. Again, the K simply has to dip below 20 while the ETI is at/below -40, so this in my mind is still a buy signal\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjv8clhuelde1.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=276d1c9fa81689745eb5dc9489a31c10b97a7fb7\n\n# Success Rate\n\nWhat does the success rate look like using this strategy? I ran a backtest using 4 hour candles from Tradingview, using the above parameters for SPY, NVDA, GOOG, AMZN, APPL & TSLA given these stocks tend to have the most liquid options. I also only included signals where the stock price (at its high) was at least $100.\n\nData went back as far as 2004 depending on the stock and when it crossed the $100 level (e.g. SPY) and a total of 175 instances were identified. When a buy signal was generated the average maximum dollar jump in the following three candles was $3.44 (vs. $2.62 when the above filters are not applied; a statistically significant difference).\n\nIn terms of thresholds, if you're looking to sell when the stock increases by $1 from the opening price of the candle following the buy signal, that occurs 69% of the time (vs. 62% of the time when the price is above $100 without the additional filters).\n\nThe results also vary by stock as seen in the table below. We can see that with the exception of AAPL and TSLA, the strategy is better than random chance at identifying at least $1 increases in the stock price in the 3 bars (12ish hours) from the buy signal.\n\n|Ticker|Less than $1 Increase|$1 Increase or greater|% Strategy|% Chance|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AAPL|10|15|60%|72%|\n|AMZN|2|23|92%|72%|\n|GOOG|2|7|78%|67%|\n|NVDA|1|6|86%|77%|\n|SPY|29|46|61%|50%|\n|TSLA|8|21|72%|88%|\n\n# Strategy for Option Trading\n\nNow that I've explained the strategy, how does it work for option trading? when I see that a signal is about to be generated, I look to buy:\n\n* ATM options with a delta of at least 0.4\n* a DTE that allows me to make a profit with a $1 increase over 2 days.\n* Once I hit my $1 increase I either sell, or set a stop-loss (acknowledging those don't always work) so I can further profit as the price goes up (remember the average increase is $3.44 with the median being $1.82 - meaning that 50% of max increases are above $1.82).\n* If $1 increase doesn't hit I exit at the close of the 3rd bar (for the 4H candles; exit at the end of the 2nd bar for 1D candles)\n\nI've already started using this strategy over the past 3 or 4 days using candles at the 4H and 1D level and have made a small profit winning 5/6 trades (the last one hit the $1 increase, but i wasn't fast enough to sell).\n\nIssues with this strategy include that when you have to buy options at the bell, the volatility can mean you get less than favourable prices given how difficult it can be to time a good buy at the bell. Additionally, while this strategy at the 1D candle works 81% of the time (i.e. 81% of the time the price will increase at least $1 over 2 days) for stocks currently in the S&P 500, this is not much better than chance (78%).\n\nI would look to hear people's feedback, thoughts, criticisms, etc.",

        "title": "Iron Condor Help (Happy Friday)",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone! Happy Friday!\n\nI wanted to come here and talk about some experience that I have had over the past couple of days for Iron Condors. I am looking to use statistics to find prices on short dated options and collect credit. I am using paper trading on Thinkorswim, while I get the hang of it and track some of the winners, losers, and fine tune my strategy. \n\nI currently use the Bollinger bands to look at standard deviation. I am trying to target companies that are large or mega cap stocks that have lots of option volume for short dated options. I know the longer out on the expiration that you go, the harder it is to fill a condor, given it has 4 legs, however you can get better spreads. I am also using RSI, and other technical indicators to find price levels (support and resistance). I am not one to try to find narrow ranges that the stock could fall on, I want to prioritize the win rate of this strategy over the total profit per trade. My thinking is that if I can win 95% of the trades, by hitting a bunch of singles (baseball reference), it is better than a homerun while taking more risk. \n\nLike I said, I am paper trading my account, and so far over the last two days, I have had to close out some legs on the condors due to heightened volatility among the mag 7 stocks. This is one of the main reasons that I am trying not to do this with real money until I get the hang of it. Despite those set backs, I have still done fairly well over a two day trial period. I intend on paper trading for several months and tracking my trades to see what works, and get a better idea of my win rates, etc. \n\nHere were some of the trades that went well for me that I opened yesterday and today. \n\nDAL (Opened on 9/5) Expiration 9/6/2024:   \nBought Put @ 40.50 strike for .05, Sold One Put @ 41.00 strike for .07. Total credit = $2 per contract.  \nSold One Call @ 44 strike for .09, Bought one call @ 44.50 strike for .05. Total Credit = $$4 per contract. \n\nTotal credit was $6 per condor and I conducted 100 condors, collecting a total credit of $600. As of close today, I was able to make my max profit. My thinking with this trade was that with the airline news yesterday, there was heightened volatility, which shot IV on this option chain up significantly, so I was able to make some money by selling a condor. I pulled up my technical analysis tools, and found the upper and lower bounds to determine where my sold calls and puts should be. Despite the profits being low relative to the max loss, I thought it was a very safe trade. Please let me know your thoughts on this, looking for feedback and a way to learn more about the condors and other strategies!\n\nAAPL (Opened 9/6) Expiration 9/6/2024:  \nBought put @ 215 strike for .05, sold one put @ 217.50 strike .15. Total credit = $10 per contract  \nSold one call @ 227.50 strike for .03, bought one call @ 230 strike for .02. Total credit = $1 per contract. \n\nTotal credit collected was $11 per condor, and like DAL, I opened 100 condors, for a total collected premium of $1100. My thinking here is that Apple is likely to trade within the range, and is less correlated and volatile to NVDA, AVGO, and other chip companies. I spotted this trade last night while looking around for opportunities at the open. Used my technical indicators the same as with the DAL. The lower IV, and a bearish bias on the stock (given the wider spreads on the put side of the condor), enabled me to collect a little more premium, however, the difference in strike prices ramped up my max loss more than the DAL trade. \n\nI had a bunch of other trades, but those are just to serve as an example. To save time I will not include all of them. But on another note...\n\nWhat are the ways you guys currently look to set up your condors? How are you looking for entries? What screeners do you use to find stocks that are trading sideways? What times are best for condors? What is your experience with condors? What are some other strategies that I should look at that have a neutral outlook on a stock? What options can I layer on top of a condor to increase credit, or lower the risk profile if the stock really moves against you? Perhaps there is a way to trade a condor around earnings to capitalize on high volatility, but also buy upside and downside protection if the stock really moves one way or another (think of a situation like AVGO today)?   \n  \nThanks in advance for all of the info everyone, talk to you in the comments!

So right then I knew that the *RSI should rebound*.  I was correct about the rebound.\n\nHowever, I failed to take note of the overall trend from premarket into open - the 200 EMA clearly showed a bearish day for $AAPL (and the other tech giants).  I’ve got the 200 EMA on everything, I just tunnel visioned in the RSI without zooming out for a sec. \n\nI bought my OTM calls at the lowest RSI dip, expecting the price to rebound - NOPE! The price kept falling and falling . . . Until about noon, but by then my position was down.  I kept watching until expiry only for my loss to realize.\n\nSo learn from me: NEVER TUNNEL VISION!!! \n\nI’ve got to regrow my cash account with $5 lol.

        "selftext": "I understand the basic concept of Calls and Puts.  Calls you are betting that the underlying stock is going to go up.  Puts you are shorting or betting that a stock is going to go down in price.  To a small degree, I understand the Strike Price.  To me, I understand it as your entry point into the market.  Let's say AAPL is $5.00 per share.  I want to make a Call that it is going up 2 dollars.  I make a strike price of $7.00.  This is where things gets complicated.  If I select $7.00 on an app like Robinhood or WeBull there's a break-even point. I did not pay attention to this until I decided I was losing too much money.  Turns out, as majority of you already know, I made OTM (Out of the money) calls.  Lower % chance of making money, but when you are right you make more money if your goal is met fast.  If I chose a $6.00 call I'm more likely ATM (At the money).  Not as high of a bet, but you can still make good money and it is less of a hurdle to make money with the right volatility, Delta, and IV (Implied Volatility). Now, ITM (In the money) has the higher chance of making money, but not necessarily the highest amount of money that can be made compared to OTM (if OTM is correct).  \n\nThis is where I get a little confused.  I understand Calls better than Puts.  My strike price I'm saying I want to have the right to purchase 100 of these shares at $ X.XX price.  Regardless, if the price hits $10.00 in a day. If you exercise Call contract, you can purchase 100 of those shares at the price of $5, $6, or $7 instead of buying 100 shares at the price of $10.00 dollars.  Makes sense to me, please correct me if I'm wrong on this.  \n\nPuts are confusing to me.  Can I lose money if the stock market goes down way too fast? Example, I make a strike price that AAPL is going to go down the next day from $10 to $8. In this scenario though, let's say the stock market crashes and AAPL goes to $2.00.  Do I lose money? Why would anyone want to buy my Put contract if they can just buy 100 shares at the $2.00 current price versus buying my Put contract that gives me the right to enter the market at $8? Would I have to hope that the price is going to rebound and appear that it is going to go past $8 dollars again? \n\n  \nSorry no TL;DR. ",

        "title": "Mastering the Wheel Strategy",
        "selftext": "Have you always wanted to master the wheel strategy—turning it into a reliable income stream while also getting paid to potentially buy shares at a discount?\n\nToo many traders segregate puts and calls into separate bets, only to fumble when the market surprises them. Thankfully, you can use the Wheel strategy instead to harness time decay, volatility swings, and assignment mechanics in your favor.\nIn this article, we’re doing more than outlining “sell puts, then sell calls.” You’ll get a full, five-stage deep dive: the theory behind why it works, real-world examples of successes and failures, step-by-step drills to lock in each skill, and advanced pro-tips that most retail traders overlook. Let’s roll.\n\n##Why The Wheel Strategy Outperforms Stand-Alone Strategies\n\nThe Wheel strategy is a logical extension of covered calls married to cash-secured puts. Rather than hoping for a one-directional move, you systematically “rent” your capital or shares to the market. First, you sell puts on a stock you’re comfortable owning; if assigned, you then sell calls to monetize holding the shares.\n\nThis rotation accomplishes two goals: you generate immediate income through time decay and implied volatility, and you avoid speculative directional risk by defining both entry (via puts) and exit (via calls) points in advance. Studies of covered-call indexes (like the BXM) show they tend to outperform buy-and-hold over decades in total return metrics, largely because they harvest option premium consistently. The Wheel simply adds the put-selling leg to capture premium even when you aren’t long shares yet.\n\nConsider a long-only call strategy: you pay a debit and face total time decay—your position can bleed to zero if you’re even one day late. A naked put sells premium to your buyer, but carries the risk of assignment if the stock gaps down. The Wheel blends them: premium buffers both directions, assignment always recoils back into another income leg, and your only true risk is carrying shares well below your discounted cost basis.\n\n##Identify Ideal Market Regimes and Stock Characteristics\n\nNot every environment or equity makes a good Wheel candidate. The optimal scenario combines moderate implied volatility (IV rank between 30–60%), a relatively stable price channel, and robust options liquidity. When IV is too low, premiums won’t justify the risk; when IV is too high, the market is signaling potential for violent moves that can blow out leveraged positions.\n\nRange-bound markets are gold mines for the Wheel. You repeatedly sell puts near support and calls near resistance, harvesting premium each time price reverts. Historical backtests on range-bound stocks like large-cap consumer staples (e.g., KO, PG) or tech giants post-earnings (e.g., AAPL after major product cycles) show premium capture on both legs can exceed 12% annualized returns, even before dividends.\n\nCrucially, you should exclude stocks with binary event risks. Stocks with week-to-week IV rank above 70% often trade in panic mode—assignment risk spikes, and rolling becomes expensive. Instead, focus on large-cap names with daily option volume north of 1,000 contracts across relevant strikes and expirations.\n\nDeep-dive drill: Build a watchlist of 10 stocks. For each, note the current IV rank, 52-week trading range, and average daily option volume. Eliminate any that fail two of those three criteria.\n\n##Preparation: Platform Setup, Cash Management, and Journal Templates\n\nBefore your first Wheel rotation, lay the groundwork. Choose a brokerage that offers advanced options analytics—think real-time Greeks, custom chain filters, and reliable exercise/assignment notifications. Interactive Brokers, ThinkOrSwim, and Tastyworks all rank highly for pro-level tools and low commissions.\n\nNext, manage your cash: since you’re selling cash-secured puts, you must reserve 100 × strike price per contract in available buying power. Treat that reserve as off-limits for stock purchases or other trades. This discipline prevents margin calls when assignments happen. If you run multiple concurrent Wheels, tally your total put obligations in a spreadsheet tab labeled “Put Reserves.”\n\nFinally, create a rolling journal template. At minimum, each trade entry should capture: underlying, leg (put or call), strike, expiration, premium received, max loss, breakeven, and assignment date. Overlay a section where you log actual P/L and notes on execution quality or market surprises. Reviewing this journal monthly will spotlight which underlyings and strike/expiration combos yield the smoothest cycles.\n\nUse a simple Google Sheet with data validation drop-downs for underlyings and strategy legs. Add conditional formatting to flag any max-loss >1.5% of account equity.\n\n##Balance Theta Decay, Delta Probability, and IV Skew\n\na. Put leg strikes & expirations:\n- Expiration: 30–45 days out. This DTE window offers optimal annualized theta decay (~3–4% daily on premium) while keeping rolling costs manageable if you need to extend. Weeklies burn too quickly; LEAPS tie up capital for months.\n- Strike: 0.20–0.30 delta. That corresponds to a 70–80% probability of expiring worthless, balancing income with assignment likelihood.\n\nb. Call leg strikes & expirations:\n- Expiration: Mirror your put cycle or choose the next monthly expiration, whichever aligns best with your tax and capital plans.\n- Strike: 0.30–0.40 delta. Higher delta calls yield more premium but increase the chance of early assignment; lower deltas pay less but may never get exercised.\n\n\n##Precision Execution, Rolling Rules, and Assignment Management\n\nExecution quality matters. Always use limit orders to capture your target premium. If the bid stays static for 15 minutes, consider improving your price by 1–2 cents to tee up a quicker fill.\n\nRolling rules: When a put is down 50% of its original premium with >7 days to expiry, rolling can lock profits and restart the cycle. For calls, if your call leg reaches 75% of max profit, buy to close and re-sell a new call further OTM or later DTE. These thresholds aren’t arbitrary—they come from optimizing the expected value of auto-roll backtests across hundreds of historical cycles.\n\nUpon put assignment, immediately sell your calls at or near the bid to capture fresh premium. If you miss the first day, you leave tens or hundreds of dollars on the table. Conversely, if a call is about to be assigned and you want to continue owning, buy back the call and roll to the next cycle rather than forfeiting shares.\n\n**Tactical checklist:**\n\n1. Pre-market: scan open puts at 2% away from your strikes.\n\n2. Mid-day: if filled, set alerts for your new covered call leg.\n\n3. Close: review any fills and log execution quality in your journal.\n\n##Final Thoughts\n\nBy layering these five deep dives—strategy rationale, market selection, preparation, strike/expiration science, and disciplined trade management—you turn the Wheel strategy from a casual idea into a systematic income machine. Start with one contract on paper, nail down your drills, then scale up as your confidence and P/L track record grow. It’s time to make the Wheel work for you—let’s get rolling!\n",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, I will try to give context to my whole situation while also keeping it brief.\n\nAfter all income minus expenses (mortgage, other) I have a surplus of about 2-3k a month that I just collect in my bank. For the past few years it was just rotting in my BOA account, but recently I moved it to Robinhood so it atleast gets 4% now.\n\nA few years ago I put 50k in GTE, sold it when it hit 65k. Had to pay taxes on the 15k. Then put the 65k into SDC. DCA’d when stock fell in half and put in another 50k. SDC went bankrupt so I lost 115k. Would be nice if I could tax harvest it some how.\n\nAlso this whole time I was not putting any money into 401k or Roth. A month ago filled up my Roth for the Robinhood bonus, and will deposit another 7k in a few days. And a few days ago I finally went to my HR portal and enabled max 401k. Why it took me this long, I don’t know.\n\nAnyways, I already made every possible financial mistake, so I was just trying to make the final biggest one of all. Timing the market. That is why I let my savings ballon to 250k (even after the SDC loss) .\n\nBut I just read somewhere that selling puts of SPY is like DCA’ing plus you also get paid a premium.\n\nAs you can see, I am financially illiterate, I’ve never traded options before, although I do have a Robinhood account, and I’m smart enough to know how to have a good job that pay wells. Can someone help me walk through this?\n\nI understand that when I enter a contract to sell puts, I buy 100 shares of that stock at the current price. If the shares go up I am mandated to sell these shares at that price I bought them, and the buyer can take those shares and instantly sell them for the higher price. \n\nIf the stock goes down however, than my option expires worthless, but I don’t care because I was hoping for that to happen if my goal was to DCA into SPY. I already bought the 100 shares. I just got paid the premium for giving someone an option to speculate on them.\n\nI have a couple of questions, first when doing this option, is there a particularly security to choose? Like SPY or VOO or SPLG or just the stocks I want to invest in like, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google.\n\nFor example, I noticed SPY has a ton of dates for selling puts, whereas SPLG only has 5 possible dates, roughly 2-3 months apart.\n\nMy goal is to maximize bid price right? The lower you try to sell the put for, usually the lower the bid price. \nAlso if I try to sell a put that expires in a few days, usually the bid price is a few dollars. A month away, it goes up to $10. But two months away, it doesn’t double to $20, it goes to around $12-$14. So that is why the most optimal puts are to buy the ones that are a month away. Because you collect the premium and can choose to invest into selling more puts again more quickly (if stock went up).\n\nShould I try to care about limit order or market order?\n\nRight now I’m looking at SPY, the current price is $588.70, and there is a put for $588 on Feb 21st with a bid price of $10.21\n\nSo irregardless, I make $1,021. If stock goes down, I was planning to DCA into SPY, so now I own 100 shares. If stock goes up, someone else makes more money. Since I have 250k, I can do this trade 4 times, and at the end of February, I either have 250k plus 4k, or I have 400 shares of SPY\n\nI guess now the question becomes how do I maximize the bid price while not doing something crazy? What is the best strategy for this?\n\nPlus I kinda do still believe in timing the market a little. I feel like there might be a sharp drop around end of Jan (Trump) and then we will probably trend downwards or sideways for a year or so. I’m curious if you guys agree or disagree or what are your market predictions. I feel like recession sentiment is growing, but I don't know how that correlates to an actual recession.",

        "selftext": "Hey all, I am not new to options, as I run the wheel strategy on AAPL and NVDA and have been fairly successful. I am starting to look in to put credit spreads on SPY and a lot of what I am reading or watching on youtube talk about opening positions 45 DTE and then closing around 21 DTE. I get that this is the optimal strategy to take advantage of theta, but when I look at the positions with around .25-.3 delta on the short put, the reward/risk ratio is usually something like 1/4 or 1/5. So if you only win about 75% of the time, you would come out negative. Am I missing something about this strategy? Does it all come down to managing your positions correctly and only opening when you are seeing a bullish market?",

My reasoning is that there is a large demand level at 157 that’s fairly illiquid to the next most recent consolidation level - also has had lots of seller attention so upside should b less priced in (feel free to lol at me). I’m down big but as a seasoned retail monkey I’ve learned that selling when it looks bad often is good in short term until price action rebalances and I played myself. \n\nTLDR: traded solid AAPL contract for spooky AMD close to AMD’s \n high of the day",

I bought a leap of apple (or I thought I did) for Aug 15, but when I then go in to try and sell that cover call at an earlier date (feb 14) which the research I’ve done says I can do, robinhood tells me to don’t have the shares to sell that? \n\nThe only thing I can think is wrong is I did not buy a leap, because one video I watched said it needs to be a year, investopedia says 9 months - I counted this month I guess this one doesn’t count? But I guess it needs to be around October to be considered a leap? \n\nHelp? \n\nEdit: looks like I need a level 3 for Robinhood. I missed that step \n\nThanks for the help! ",
