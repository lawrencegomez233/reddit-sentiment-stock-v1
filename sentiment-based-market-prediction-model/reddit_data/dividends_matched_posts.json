Apple just launched an update (only for developers tho) and soon we´ll see a new “Apple Intelligence” in all our devices. If everything goes well, this will be available this fall.\n\n\n\nIn other Apple news, if you were paying attention back in 2018, Tim Cook, our famous CEO said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rate (like Brazil and Russia), there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple decided to cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.\n\n\n\nAnd just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.\n\n\n\nThis led to several big scandals and lawsuits based on Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).\n\n\n\nSo, at this point, this whole story is going to an end because recently, Apple decided to pay $490M to investors due to the situation (even before the court hearing), so if you were one of those damaged investors, you can[ check it out](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).\n\n\n\nHowever, does that half a billion even come close to covering the $70 billion loss? Especially with all the drama Apple's dealing with in China?\n\n",

I wanted to share my strategy, what I’ve accomplished so far, and hopefully hear about your approaches too!\n\nHere’s how I’m building my portfolio:\n\nReinvesting all dividends\nEvery dollar I earn in dividends goes straight back into buying more shares. Compounding is a powerful force, and this strategy helps my income grow faster.\n\nFocusing on companies with stable dividends\nI prioritize companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Coca-Cola (KO), and McDonald’s (MCD) for their decades-long track record of steady payouts. They’re the foundation of my passive income.\n\nDiversifying with ETFs\nFunds like SCHD and JEPI give me exposure to a broad range of companies, balancing growth and income potential.\n\nAdding REITs for monthly income\nRealty Income (O) and STAG Industrial (STAG) pay monthly dividends, which feel like small wins every month and could cover expenses as my portfolio grows.\n\nIncluding growth companies with dividends\nI also hold Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). While their dividends aren’t as high as some others, I see long-term capital appreciation with a dividend bonus.\n\nRight now, I need around $30,000 annually to cover basic expenses, and my portfolio has reached about 10% of that target. It feels great to see progress, even if it’s slow and steady!\n\nI’d love to hear from you, what’s working well for you on your dividend journey?
