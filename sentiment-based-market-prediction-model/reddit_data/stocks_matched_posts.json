        "selftext": "Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.\n\nIn early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.\n\n I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.\n\n Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  \n\nThese were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. \n\nI sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. \n\nAnd…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.\n\nEvery year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.\n\nEvery time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.\n\n•\t2-for-1 split in 2000  \n•\t2-for-1 split in 2005  \n•\t7-for-1 split in 2014  \n•\t4-for-1 split in 2020\n\nNowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.\n\nThe security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.\n\nI do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  \n\nI do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",

        "selftext": "Apple’s overall revenue rose by 4% in the first quarter, but it missed on Wall Street’s iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported on Thursday. \n\nHere’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 28. \n\nEarnings per share: $2.40 vs. $2.35 estimated \n\nRevenue: $124.30 billion vs. $124.12 billion estimated \n\n iPhone revenue: $69.14 billion vs. $71.03 billion estimated \n\nMac revenue: $8.99 billion vs. $7.96 billion estimated \n\niPad revenue: $8.09 billion vs. $7.32 billion estimated \n\nOther Products revenue: $11.75 billion vs. $12.01 billion estimated \n\nServices revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated \n\nGross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated \n\n Although Apple’s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company’s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  \n\nApple’s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. \n\nThe company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It’s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. \n\nApple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn’t accessible in China or in Chinese. \n\n“During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,” Cook said.  \n\nCook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company’s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in “channel inventory,” the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  \n\n“If you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,” Cook said. \n\nApple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. \n\nThe company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. \n\nApple’s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year’s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. \n\nThe company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  \n\n“It’s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,” Cook said.  \n\nApple’s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store system.  \n\nThe company’s “other products” category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. \n\nApple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.   \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/apple-aapl-q1-earnings-2025.html",

While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  \n\n“On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that’s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.  \n\nCook said that while Apple doesn’t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  \n\n“What we’ve done is we’ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,” Cook said. “From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners’ financials, and we would be paying expense.” \n\n“Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we’re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,” Cook continued.  \n\nApple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. \n\nCook said that about half of iPad buyers haven’t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. \n\nApple’s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  \n\nApple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under “Wearables, Home, and Accessories.” Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  \n\n“A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we’re still growing that base significantly,” Cook said.  \n\nThe Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company’s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple’s forecast and LSEG estimates. \n\nApple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple’s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  \n\nApple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple’s App Store.  \n\nHowever, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  \n\n“Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,” Cook said. “Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.” \n\nApple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q3-2024.html",

The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.\n\nNotably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.\n\n\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.\n\nAs trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.\n\n\"The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,\" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate \"this new world of tariffs.\"\n\nUntil then, he warned, \"tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.\"\n\nOther Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.\n\nIn afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.\n\nOutside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.\n\n\"The implications \\[of the announced tariffs\\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \\[chip\\] sector,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. \"These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.\"\n\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs.

The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.\n\n\"Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,\" Buffett wrote.\n\n'FISCAL FOLLY'\n\nThis year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.\n\n\"Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,\" Buffett said.\n\nBuffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.\n\nHe said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,\nBut he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism \"has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,\" with malfeasance by \"scoundrels and promoters\" in full force.\n\nHe urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying \"fiscal folly\" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times \"come close to the edge.\"\n\nBuffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the \"American miracle,\" has depended on people's ability to participate.\n\nThat, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.\n\n\"Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,\" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.\n\"And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,\" he added.\n\nCathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire \"hold,\" said: \"Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.\"\n\nFEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWhile Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.\n\nOther stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.\n\nBerkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.\nThe company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.\n\nOver the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.\n\n\"They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,\" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.\n\nTens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.\n\nBuffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been \"eliminated or greatly minimized.\"\n\nThe meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.\nIn discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.\n\n\"We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,\" he said. \"In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.\"\n\n",

I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.\n\nThen I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.\n\nIt doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.\n\nHowever, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.\n\nLastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful\n\n[AAPL business segment revenue 2024 Q1-Q4](https://preview.redd.it/chcmjkylhj6e1.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbbca8158c8b697ff8f97ccc847321d052c49118)\n\nAll in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.\n\nPosition: long \\~$21,000 in shares",

        "title": "Apple revenue tops Wall Street expectations but Services division disappoints",
        "selftext": "Apple reported second fiscal-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company’s closely-watched Services division came up light versus estimates.  \n\nHere’s how Apple did versus consensus estimates for the quarter ending in March: \n\n* EPS $1.65 vs. $1.63 estimated by LSEG \n\n* Revenue: $95.4 billion vs. $94.66 billion estimated by LSEG \n\n* iPhone revenue: $46.84 billion vs. $45.84 billion estimated, per StreetAccount \n\n* Mac revenue: $7.95 billion vs. $7.77 billion estimated, per StreetAccount  \n\n* iPad revenue: $6.4 billion vs. $6.20 billion estimated, per StreetAccount \n\n* Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $7.52 billion vs. $7.95 billion, per StreetAccount \n\n* Services revenue: $26.65 billion vs. $26.70 billion, per StreetAccount \n\n* Gross margin: 41.7% vs. 47.1%, per StreetAccount \n\nThe company reported $1.65 per share on $24.78 billion of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period. \n\nApple typically provides data points about how it sees the current quarter shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is highly anticipating CEO Tim Cook’s first public comments on how Apple will navigate rapidly-shifting tariffs proposed by the Trump administration. \n\nAnalysts are looking for third-quarter guidance of $1.48 in earnings per share on $89.45 billion of sales. \n\nCook told CNBC that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than they are from China. Apple still makes the “vast majority” of its products for other countries from China, Cook said.  \n\n“If you look at the U.S., over half of the U.S. sales of iPhone come from India,” Cook said. “If you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.” \n\nCook said the iPhone uses a lot of chips made domestically, and that Apple is buying 19 billion chips this year from the U.S.  \n\n“With an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,” he said.  \n\nApple said its board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases this quarter, down from $110 billion in authorization last year. Apple also said it would pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, a 4% increase. \n\n“We continue to plan for annual dividend increases,” Cook said.  \n\nThe company’s most important product line, iPhones, topped estimates at $46.8 billion in sales during the quarter. The overall product line’s sales were up just under 2% on an annual basis.  \n\nApple’s profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google.  \n\nCook, in a statement, hailed “double-digit” Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple’s services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter.  \n\nApple hardware generally did well during the quarter. \n\nMac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March.  \n\nHowever, Apple’s wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. \n\nSales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates.  \n\nOn the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple’s largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order “pull forward” because of tariffs.  \n\n“We don’t believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,” Cook said. “There’s no obvious evidence of it.” \n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2025-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2025-.html)",

        "selftext": "Apple is the world’s most valuable company, the most beloved consumer brand, and the best-run capital return machine in the modern stock market. It has survived every bear thesis, adapted to every challenge, and delivered shareholders a relentless stream of buybacks, dividends, and steady earnings growth.\n\nAt 33x forward earnings, the market is pricing Apple as if it will continue this dominance indefinitely. But no company can defy gravity forever. Apple’s next phase of growth depends on emerging markets, where its traditional advantages—brand strength, pricing power, and ecosystem lock-in—are not guaranteed to work the same way they have in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMuch like a perfectly applied face of makeup, Apple looks flawless at first glance. But take a closer look, and a few cracks start to appear. Buybacks are masking slowing earnings growth. Services margins, long assumed to be unassailable, are under regulatory threat. And in markets where Apple is banking on its next wave of users, it’s facing competition from companies that know these regions better and are playing an entirely different game.\n\nThe market assumes Apple will extend its dominance effortlessly. The data suggests otherwise.\n\n# The Market Assumes the iPhone Will Conquer Everywhere. That’s a Risky Bet.\n\nIn North America, Apple’s pricing power is sacred. In emerging markets, it is anything but.\n\nApple’s dominance in the U.S. is built on two things: a premium brand and a seamless ecosystem. People don’t leave iOS because switching out of iMessage, AirDrop, and the App Store is a hassle. But in places like India, Latin America, and Africa, the default phone isn’t an iPhone. It’s an Android device, often made by Xiaomi, OPPO, or Transsion, where users have already built their own ecosystems of digital services.\n\nThat’s a problem for Apple’s long-term growth. If users in these markets don’t start on iOS, they aren’t going to be locked into Apple’s ecosystem later. And in the places where Apple is growing, it’s often doing so by selling older iPhones at discounted prices—an approach that works for market share but erodes the premium pricing model that has sustained its margins.\n\nApple is winning some battles, but at what cost?\n\n* **Latin America**: iPhone shipments jumped 21% year-over-year in 2024, but most of that growth came from discounted older models and local assembly in Brazil to avoid import tariffs. The broader smartphone market in the region grew 10% in the same period. That means Apple isn’t necessarily taking over—it’s just keeping up by cutting prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi continues to outsell Apple, offering comparable hardware at a fraction of the price.\n* **India**: Apple is making its biggest push yet, opening flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi, ramping up local manufacturing, and introducing aggressive financing options. Morgan Stanley estimates India will account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth over the next five years. But the market reality is stark: iOS has less than 11% market share, and the vast majority of smartphones sold in India cost under $300. Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.\n* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.\n* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.\n\nThe big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.\n\n# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.\n\nApple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.\n\nBut Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.\n\n* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.\n* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.\n* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.\n\nThe App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.\n\nInvestors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.\n\n# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.\n\nApple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.\n\n* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.\n* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.\n* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.\n\n# When Does Apple Become a Buy?\n\nApple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:\n\n* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.\n* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.\n* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.\n\nApple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price? I don't think it is.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI’m new to equity analysis and have put together the above deep dive on Apple’s valuation, particularly its challenges in emerging markets and risks to services growth. Please let me know what you think about Apple's share price and future.\n\nI work on these memos for my own personal investments. I hold Apple indirectly through VGT.\n\n**TLDR:** My analysis indicates Apple is a weaker equity than people might think —Apple’s future growth relies on price-sensitive markets where it lacks its usual pricing power, while services, its high-margin growth driver, faces regulatory threats. Without a new major revenue stream, growth looks constrained. Management has a strong track record of launching successful businesses, but at 33x forward earnings believing they’ll pull something new out of the hat requires a leap of faith.",

        "selftext": "**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. \n\n>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\n>\n\n>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.\n\n>\n\n>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\n>\n\n>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.\n\n>\n\n>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\n>\n\n>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>\n\n>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”\n\n>\n\n>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\n>\n\n>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\n>\n\n>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.\n\n>\n\n>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\n>\n\n>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.\n\n>\n\n>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/apple-and-spacex-link-up-to-support-starlink-satellite-network-on-iphones](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/apple-and-spacex-link-up-to-support-starlink-satellite-network-on-iphones)",

I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a “shareholder-funded AI experiment”.\n\n\n\nApple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?\n\n",

Eventhough real tech people might not be a fan of having to wait most normal people will want a smooth experience which is well integrated even if it takes longer, their userbase likes the walled garden and will not change companies quickly. The big providers have said they see that people are waiting for the iphone sixteen and I think that it will be something people get exited about it doesn’t have to be the best new ai ever for most people the bitmoji and recorded calls will be what they will use most and will be envious about.

Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont.

MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.\n\nThat fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.\n\nI agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best.

Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas\n3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  \nPotential Risks  \n1.

        "selftext": "I think traders and close market analysts realize this more than many people do. From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.\nFundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or \"still a bull market\" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)\n\nSome concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. \n\nSo yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming \"anti USA\" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.\n\nThis is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. \n\nHere's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.\n\n\n\nThere's a school of thought that says \"markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable\" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will \"always\" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.\nAnother consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now. ",

Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.\n\nTSMC, the world’s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company’s first factory began mass production late last year.\n\nTSMC’s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.\n\nSince the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC’s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer—key factors for AI applications.\n\n[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.\n\n“We’re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,” TSMC said in a statement.\n\nU.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.—although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs.

        "selftext": "President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.\n\nBut there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.\n\nBacking off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was \"significant\" and \"very justified,\" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.\n\nIt \"may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,\" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.\n\nThe stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.\n\nThe final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for \"general search\" and \"general search text.”\n\nNo matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.\n\nFinal remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.\n\nIt didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.\n\n\"Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,\" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.\n\nIt argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”\n\nThey also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.\n\nBut prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.\n\nAnthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.\n\nDerek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.\n\n\"They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.\"\n\nThe tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.\n\n\"What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.\n\n\"It seems ill-timed to do that.\"\n\nThe DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.\n\nIt asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.\n\nThat is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.\n\nBernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.\n\nGoogle countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.\n\nMcCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.\n\n\"Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,\" McCareins said.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-doj-wants-a-google-breakup-but-is-willing-to-leave-ai-alone-080016759.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACYwia9l044SxGCK_mri0gx-4TVLrnZzE1cLyqspOVq-n2zGEeY521rJZBcbAtAtZpG9pjQwjgHdoWCYutDGYaydayerBR3eZ7CxOK4KvoFb-5qR8PHIRJROnWQ40ALMQ9_HnlhH1NvgeQDycPTYmotjrq1CJK9_Z0lsxa8n3nyq",

That highlighted the way the Trump administration’s tariffs campaign — peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods — is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.\n\nInvestors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.’s artificial intelligence chips.\n\nLast year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.\n\nThe value of phone component exports to India — home to Apple’s biggest iPhone production base outside of China — roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.\n\nApple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home. The device has never been produced in the US, a project that appears unfeasible at least in the short run.",

After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.\n\nReuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.\n\n\"Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,\" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. \"There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.\"\n\nA Broadcom spokesperson said the company is \"evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.\"\n\nIntel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.\n\nBroadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.\n\nSome of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.\n\n**CRUCIAL SETBACK**\n\nAs part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.\n\nIntel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.\n\nIntel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.\n\nTypically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.\n\nBroadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.\n\nFor an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.\n\nTSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.\n\nMoving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.\n\nBetting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.\n\nIntel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.\n\nThe company plans to be \"manufacturing-ready\" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers \"actively engaged\" with the tool kit.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-manufacturing-business-suffers-setback-broadcom-tests-disappoint-sources-2024-09-04/",

        "title": "The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ",
        "selftext": "Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. \n\nThe ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.\n\nAccording to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.\n\nBelow is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..\n\n|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|1933.5|10.91||\n|1940|12.05|10.44%|\n|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|\n|1953|26.38|43.13%|\n|1959.5|58.68|122%|\n|1966|92.88|58%|\n|1972.5|107.14|15%|\n|1979|99.93|-7.22%|\n|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|\n|1992|408.78|113%|\n|1998.5|1133.84|177%|\n|2005|1181.27|4.10%|\n|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|\n|2018|2471.65|87.10%|\n|2024.5|5525.29|123%|\n\nWhile the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.\n\nHistorically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.\n\nCurrently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.\n\nIn the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...\n\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).\n* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).\n\nImages aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07\n\nHistorically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.\n\n* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.\n* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.\n* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).\n\n**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**\n\nOutside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.\n\n* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.\n* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.\n* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.\n* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.\n* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.\n* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.\n* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.\n* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).\n* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.\n* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.\n* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.\n* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.\n* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.\n* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.\n* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.\n\nI believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.\n\n**This economic downturn may be severe.**\n\nIn the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.\n\n**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**\n\nPeople have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.\n\nThis will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.\n\n**What happens from here?**\n\nI don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.\n\nThe prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. \n\n**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**\n\nMy positions: \n\nBought 50 $570 10/2 puts at open this morning right at open. I'm up about 18k on them.   \nBought 12 $565 10/1 puts at 9:30 CST. I am up about $80 on them.   \nBought 35 UVXY $42 Calls exp 10/4 at about 10AM CST.

Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.\n\nA U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.\n\nAfter markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.\n\n# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report\n\nWednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.\n\nTrump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.\n\n# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market\n\nGameStop’s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which fired up the meme stock craze in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies centering their business models on buying bitcoin.\n\nAI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle’s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SoftBank as part of a joint venture known as Stargate to build AI infrastructure. Adobe’s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the company’s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.\n\n# This Week’s Calendar\n\n**Monday, June 9**\n\n* Wholesale inventories (April)\n* Apple’s (AAPL) WWDC conference begins with CEO Tim Cook's keynote address and special event\n* Key Earnings: Casey’s General Stores (CASY)\n\n**Tuesday, June 10**\n\n* NFIB Small Business Optimism Index (May)\n* Key Earnings: GameStop, J.M.

Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.\n\nIntel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.\n\nRisks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.\n\nRelated Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM\n\nTicker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.\n\nContext: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.\n\nSector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.\n\nRisks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.\n\nRelated Tickers: T/VZ/RKLB",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025.

I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.\n\nPrevious generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload.

Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads.

With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\n**Stay agile, and be on the lookout for tariff news from Beijing.**\n\nNews: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.\n\n[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.\n\n[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the \"worst housing market in almost 50 years.\" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.\n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to \"Liberation Day\" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.\n\n[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan. The White House clarified that semis are exempt from these tariffs, which provides a buffer for NVIDIA's core business and limits downside risk from the new trade measures. We still saw a 6% move post-tariff announcement.",

Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\-OpenAI announced the acquisition of Jony Ive's AI hardware startup for $6.4B. This is the first shot in what I consider the \"AI Consumer Hardware War\" (sorry Humane Pin, you don't count lol). This positions OpenAI to develop a new generation of AI-powered devices and could challenge Apple in the AI space. Stock fell intraday yesterday 2-3%, interested to see if we continue that selloff. Watching the 200 level as well. Apple has essentially fallen flat with AI (Apple Intelligence) and hasn't struck gold recently with any good hardware, we can safely consider the Apple Vision a bust.\n\n[**FICO (FICO)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FICO&p=d)\\-FHFA director William J. Pulte called for the provider of credit scores to be more \"economical\" and that FHFA is considering replacing the tri-merge credit score model with a bi-merge system to cut costs. Already long from $1700 yesterday, we're down close to 30% on a remark that thinks a $1.50 increase in its wholesale royalty for mortgage originations is too high. The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.\n\n[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\-The stock has been on a monster run, and I'm interested in the short today. We've gone from \\~$50 to \\~$120 at the peak premarket, watching $100 level to see if we bounce off it or if we continue selling off. Most immediate risk I foresee is massive volatility; we're in speculation territory when it comes to this stock now.\n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\-Reports suggest the insurer made covert payments to nursing homes to limit hospital transfers, aiming to reduce costs, raising concerns over care practices. I won't include the context because I'm sure all of you are sick to death (this is a joke) of hearing about it from Reddit.

Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. \n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday).

So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.\n\nRECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically \"perfect company.\" The dream attributes of such a company go as:\n\n***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***\n\nCompanies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.\n\nMy examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)\n\n***It Does Something Dull:***\n\nCompanies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.\n\nMy examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)\n\n***It Does Something Disagreeable:***\n\nBusinesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.\n\nMy Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)\n\n***It’s a Spinoff:***\n\nCorporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.\n\nFound a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)\n\n***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***\n\nStocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These \"ignored\" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.\n\nMy examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)\n\n***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***\n\nLynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.\n\nMy examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)\n\n***There’s Something Depressing About It:***\n\nCompanies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.\n\nMy examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)\n\n***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.\n\nMy examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)\n\n***It’s Got a Niche:***\n\nA strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits\n\nMy examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)\n\n***People Have to Keep Buying It:***\n\nLynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.\n\nMy examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)\n\n***It's a User of Technology:***\n\nCompanies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.\n\nMy examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)\n\n***The Insiders are Buyers:***\n\nInsider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nMy examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)\n\n***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***\n\nCompanies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.\n\nMy examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",

This policy aims to \"align\" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).\n\n[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)\\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids.

Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?\n\nThe **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:\n\n✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals\n\n✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly\n\n✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements\n\nHis strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.\n\nNot every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g \n\n* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits\n* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel\n* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power\n* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs\n* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge\n* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump\n* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners\n\nCompanies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g\n\n* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk\n* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins\n* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs\n* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production\n* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs\n* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers\n* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders \n\nAre you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?\n\n  \nTrump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.\n\nThe problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, September 16th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await major Fed decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/15/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-investors-await-major-fed-decision-live-updates.html)\n*****\n> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.\n*****\n> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.\n*****\n> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.\n*****\n> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.\n*****\n> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.\n*****\n> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.\n*****\n> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/JeXzAYR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Md5UMKo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/sVxpfGU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/G9jtrZ5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/fqLKXyh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/L4mNSBX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uKAl54m.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/WZb12Gv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BJzVcBV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Gc325TT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/qMjgcOp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/0k12aGQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E9zVA8r.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/z9ng4cU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/FYLfnGf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/nPDYney.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-mu-aapl-intc-aa-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Trump Media & Technology** — Shares rose more than 1%, extending the 11% gain from Friday.

My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I don’t understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted?

Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies.\n\n> The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said.\n\n> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025. It’s one world.”",

        "selftext": "Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.\n\nThe chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThe selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. \n\nNvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”\n\nThe analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”\n\nBut after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.\n\nData center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.\n\nFor Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.\n\nNvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.\n\nThe sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.\n\n“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.\n\nNvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-sheds-almost-600-billion-in-market-cap-biggest-drop-ever.html",

Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a \"potential supercycle\" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.\n\nIn my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.\n\nTo me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.\n\nHere’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!\n\nTl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft\n\nP.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft.

Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren’t made in the US. Setting up domestic manufacturing would take years.\n\nThe products that won’t be subject to Trump’s new tariffs also include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US as well as other chipmakers.\n\nThe tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China.\n\nOne such exclusion was for semiconductors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn’t yet done so but the latest exclusions appear to correspond with that exemption. Trump’s sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25%, though it’s not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be.\n\n",

        "selftext": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first\n\nNearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.\nOver the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.\n\nWhile it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.\nTom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.\nOne of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.\n\nSince 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”\nHowever, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.\n\nThe upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.\n\nAll of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.\nIn fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.\nMarkets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.\nMr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.\n“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”\n",

Google at least won’t be entirely impacted by tariffs and they’re the leader in AI right now. Apple is being thrown around with tariffs but they’re extremely profitable. Nvidia is also undervalued because they’re pretty much the only way to train AI which is the next frontier. Broadcom also has insane revenue growth and momentum. What do yall think? ",

        "selftext": "For all three dividend payout yield sits at around 0.5%. This means that even if the payouts were trebled (and this would take several years of incremental increases, unless the tree decide to go the Visa route and increase payouts by around 10% per annum) the investor would only gain an anemic 1.5% CAGR from dividends. I understand that tech companies aren't the place you go for dividend payouts, but 0.5% or less seems somewhat pointless to me.",

Instead, the 16E moves to a Face ID-enabled notch and adds the latest A18 chip and support for Apple Intelligence under the surface, with a starting price of $599.\n\nThe 16E is a kind of iPhone SE successor based on the design of 2022’s iPhone 14, meaning it fits the front-facing cameras required for Face ID (and selfies) into a notch that cuts down from the top of the phone rather than the Dynamic Island design found on the company’s latest flagship phones.\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/news/609204/apple-iphone-16e-price-release-date-specs-a18-notch-face-id",
