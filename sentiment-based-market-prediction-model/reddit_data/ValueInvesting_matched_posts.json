        "selftext": "I am pretty sure that a lot of AAPL shareholders are frustrated about the current performance.\n\nNVDA, MSFT, and META are heading to ATH. Even the meme TSLA outperforms rotten AAPL. AMZN is doing better job than AAPL on the market.\n\n**AI**\n\nIn my opinion, AI is overrated. The market wants to see more AI-related news from AAPL. However, AAPL has no in-house LLMs.\n\nLLMs are cloud-based commodities, which will be run at marginal cost. Since Deepseek, we know that open source-based LLMs are just commodities and have no MOAT.\n\nThere has been a rumor that AAPL might buy Perplexity. But Perplexity relies on GUI system and no in-house LLMs. Perplexity as a GUI system based company orchestrates ChatGPT, Claude, Antrophic, and Gemini to provide results out of that.\n\nThere is no MOAT. It would be a failed M&A for AAPL if AAPL acquires Perplexity.\n\nPerplexity has no traction, because this company is not even in TOP 100 at App Store.\n\nWhen we get the news that even META tried to talk to Perplexity for a possible M&A, I highly assumes that Perplexity offers themselves, because:\n\n1. Perplexity knows that they can´t survive as a stand alone company sooner or later.\n2. the bankers want to drive the market value of Perplexity up.\n\nAAPL is lagging behind in AI, but AAPL can power their competitive advantages with their powerful eco-system (iOS). AAPL needs to figure out how to provide a solid feature to users.\n\nSiri must be more intelligent. As AAPL has doomed Siri for over 10 years and has presented their future direction with Siri already at WWDC 2024, the time is ticking that AAPL needs to deliver their promise.\n\n**Tariffs**\n\nIt is not AAPL´s fault, but AAPL has been very timid. AAPL has moved their production for the US market from China to India. However, Trump dissed Tim Cook that he does not like their re-location from China to India. Instead of that, Trump would like to see AAPL move from China to the US.\n\nSince then, Tim Cook has been silent. It gives a clear contradiction from Jensen Huang from Nvidia reacted when his super computer H-20 is banned for China.\n\nJensen Huang immediately responded to this action and has been on trips world wide to cover the potential loss from China. He was very pro-active to Trump to keep Nvdia´s stock performance. But Tim Cook has been very timid so far and does not really show his pro-active move to negotiate with Trump.\n\nWhile other CEOs are chasing AI-startups and talents, Tim Cook rather hangs out with Hollywood stars for premier F1.\n\nTariffs will affect AAPL negatively. If Tariffs will drive their sales down, we will see in the upcoming Q2, Q3 and Q4.\n\n**Slow innovation**\n\nPeople claim that AAPL has lost their innovative mindset. However, the innovation has never been the reason for their success. iPhone was not the first smartphone.\n\nThe reason for their success is that AAPL has provided the most optimized solution for user-friendly device. I can´t imagine to type blackberry or Nokia things. Additionally, Sony, which introduced the first concept of a smartphone, could not provide a seamless solution for their concept, because Sony was so behind in Software and eco-system based infrastructure.\n\nAAPL could master a seamless and user-friendly device with their own iOS eco-system, which just works.\n\n\"It works\" principle has been the reason for their success.\n\nHowever, AAPL is very slow to bring out some HW-related features. Their foldable phone will be launched next year although Samsung has been on the foldable market for 7 years already.\n\nThere is also a rumor that AAPL can´t achieve their original design (All Glass) for 20th anniversary.\n\nAAPL needs to justify why people should upgrade their phones. But until now, AAPL has failed to provide a proper solution for that. People still buy iPhones, but their growth rate is just under 5% at PE (FWD) 26x.\n\n**What can drive AAPL up?**\n\nSimple. Tim Cook needs to deliver \"way better than expected\" Q2 to get back to where AAPL was at the end of last year. Additionally, Tim Cook needs to deliver a promising forecast even if AAPL does not give any forecasts, but Tim Cook needs to let Wall Street know that AAPL is quite confident to beat the market.\n\nAAPL needs to promote more about their healthcare-driven strategy. I strongly believe that AAPL is heavily and serioulsy interested in healthcare sector. But AAPL has been very timid and had some lawsuits with other companies for patents at Apple Watch.\n\n",

Many market commentators proclaimed that Apple “lost its edge” and was well passed their prime. This was basically consensus opinion at the time, every analyst and news article was playing the same song. Here are a few headlines:During Berkshire’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett attributed much of Berkshire’s performance to the compounding ability of Apple ($AAPL). He went as far as thanking the CEO personally.\n\nThe Apple bet is notable not only for it’s fantastic returns, but by the shear scale of the capital deployed ($35 billion over the years).

Seizing a large position in Apple during a period of temporary turbulence was a masterstroke. It is instructive to understand Berkshire’s reasoning at the time and what the situation looked like to most investors.\n\nThere were plenty of good reasons for Apple’s stock to fall at the time. Overall, they appeared to become a lethargic and oversized stalwart, likened to IBM. They lost their image as a fast growing innovator that had found its second wind in consumer electronics (it is easy to forget that Apple was founded back in 1976).\n\nThis was not a founder-led business anymore. During the Steve Jobs period, they had come up with sleek minimalist designs and a series of products that delighted consumers (iPod, iTouch and iPhone). By 2016 this momentum had stagnated, reflected in somewhat repetitive iterations of their products. Apple began to branch off into the car industry with *Project Titan,* which ran unsuccessfully from 2014-2024. This would be an example of Peter Lynch’s term “diworsification.” There were also a few short-term causes for concern:\n\n1. Apple reported its first year-over-year sales decline since 2003.\n2. First-ever drop in iPhone unit sales. Deemed to be over-reliant on the iPhone.\n3. Spent more money on its new campus than on research and development.\n4. Chinese regulators shut down Apple’s online book/video services.\n\n**In 2016, the company’s PE ratio dropped under 13** to complete the set-up. The **earnings yield was 8-9%** throughout the year.\n\n**Taking out the big guns:**\n\nBerkshire began with a $1 billion investment in Apple in the first quarter of 2016, increasing their position continuously over the course of the year. While market commentators were focused on short-term headwinds, Berkshire was focused on the underlying quality of Apple’s business. They saw through the noise and perceived the true *essence* of the business. The secret sauce.\n\nIn a press release from October 2016 by *Manager Magazin* (a German business magazine), Ted Weschler explained the rationale behind Berkshire Hathaway’s Apple investment:\n\n>*Apple has elements of a subscription model that protects it from competition and could keep margins elevated for the long term, according to major investor Berkshire Hathaway. That is a large difference to former smartphone competitors Nokia, Blackberry and Motorola…*\n\n>*Weschler says that the smartphone business had been transformed by the app economy and cloud computing. “As network speed has gotten faster and faster, and with it the information that people can absorb on the network, things like photo applications, and apps, they create a stickier ecosystem”. “Once you are fully invested in the App ecosystem and you have got your thousands of photographs up in the cloud and you are used to the keystrokes and functionality and where everything is, you become a sticky consumer.”*\n\nThey recognized the importance of a sticky ecosystem in retaining consumers over time. There was a powerful interplay between the Mac operating system, downloading from the iStore, listening to iTunes, storage on iCloud, communication on iMessenger/FaceTime and all the other products starting with “i”. Even their chargers were only compatible with Apple devices at the time. This ecosystem offered convenience for its users while secretly increasing switching costs. Consumers would have to expend mental effort in order to learn a new system that was less integrated.\n\nBerkshire was not a group of technology experts, but they were experts on consumer behavior. While innovation was important, Apple did not need to produce the most advanced technology to be successful. Their higher profit margins were due to their brand image and the stickiness of their ecosystem. Buffett recognized that Apple users would rather “[give up a second car](https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/06/buffett-says-apple-best-business-of-any-he-owns/)” than give up their iPhone. Delighted customers translated into incredible brand loyalty and massive returns on capital. Even during the 2016-2017 trough, their ROIC hardly ever went below 20% before re-accelerating back into the 40% range. Maintaining a high ROIC over long periods of time is an indicator of a true competitive advantage.\n\n**The Results:**\n\nThey added to their position continuously over the years and their total $35 billion investment was worth $173 billion in 2023. \n\n\\- Stock Doctor\n\n[Find the full article and charts here.](https://stockdoctor.substack.com/p/case-study-berkshires-big-bet-on?r=2c93i1)",

I base my analysis on the idea of discounting cash, in particular, the retained earnings of APPL attributable to the ownership of BRK. The 5.6% ownership generates 5.6 billion of retained earnings yearly (Warren even mentions it in an annual shareholder letter, but the calculation is trivial). Now, *given current interest* rates one can earn 5.5 billion just by having 100 billion invested in US T-bills.\n\nConsidering that the market cap for APPL in this period was 3300 billion, then 5.6% gives us 184 billion of market value. In other words, BRK could sell a little over half of its holdings and have 84 billion invested at AAPL and 100 billion in cash. Thus, it will have 2 billion in retained earnings, *plus* 5.5 billion of the 100 billion *in cash* it would get from the transaction.\n\nIt might be argued that interest rates could drop substantially, but again at current market levels this would not be the case unless the market went down considerably. In which case the yearly interest does go down, but then the usefulness of the 100 billion in cash does skyrocket. Finally, corporate taxes at 21% did made Warren justify a bit that it’s not necessarily a bad rate compared to what it can be (52% in the past).",

        "selftext": "Today, I'm diving into the lessons from the 2022 stock market crash and how they apply to the current market downturn. Are we seeing history repeat itself with new opportunities emerging?\n\nMy original post: [https://deepvalueanalysis.substack.com/p/2022-crash-vs-today-lessons-learned](https://deepvalueanalysis.substack.com/p/2022-crash-vs-today-lessons-learned)\n\n# A. Lessons from the 2022 Crash\n\n# A.1. Lessons about Financials and Valuations\n\n**a. OCF and FCF are #2, and #1 respectively**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nNet income has been debunked time and time as a good measure of value in investments, but it is still being taken at face value by many investors and I believe that all value investors, including myself, ought to explain why it is not a good measurement.\n\nFirst of all, the reason OCF is much better is that you are actually measuring the real cash flow of your business. You don’t pay dividends or do stock buybacks from amortization or depreciation. You can’t change OCF whenever you want through complicated accounting methods. (Check [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal)) - Enron is a classic case study of why you never look at NI without first checking OCF and FCF.\n\nSecond of all, OCF has an even better alternative, and that is FCF. FCF is the big test of whether OCF is “Bullsh\\*t” or “Real”. Now, you may be asking yourself what do I mean by this. What I am referring to is the classic case of heavy CapEx companies that have high OCF and low FCF. After all, OCF is only useful if you can spend it, but if a company constantly requires high CapEx, then the real measure of value is FCF. (Check Auto, Steel and Industrial).\n\nPractical Example:  \nTech which has both high OCF and high FCF recovered extremely well from the 2022 drop, whilst Auto, Steel and Industrials are lacking. Intel is a tech business that is the epitome of “Spend until you drop”\n\n**b. Valuations don’t last forever**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nAll bubbles pop, I don’t think that it is necessary to explain the concept too much, because everyone knows that nothing lasts forever, in particular stock market bubbles.\n\nPractical Example:  \n1907, 1929, 1937, 1962, 1987, 1990, 2000, 2008, 2020, 2022, 2025 (Now).\n\n**c. FFO, AFFO for REITs**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nWhen you’re dealing with REITs, traditional metrics like Net Income or even Free Cash Flow can lead you seriously astray. Why? Because of the unique accounting treatment of real estate—specifically depreciation. Imagine owning a building that gains value every year, but accounting tells you it’s losing value because of depreciation. That’s exactly what happens with REITs.\n\nThat’s where Funds From Operations (FFO) comes in. FFO adds back depreciation and amortization to net income, and removes gains on sales of property, giving a clearer picture of how much cash the REIT is actually generating from its operations. It’s like OCF, but real estate flavored.\n\nBut even FFO isn’t the full picture. Enter Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)—this metric goes one step further by subtracting recurring CapEx (maintenance costs, tenant improvements, etc.). AFFO is essentially the REIT version of Free Cash Flow, showing what the REIT can actually return to shareholders after keeping the lights on.\n\nIf FFO is “cash coming in,” then AFFO is “cash you can actually use.” That’s why savvy REIT investors focus heavily on AFFO per share growth.\n\nPractical Example:\n\nTake Realty Income (O), the so-called “Monthly Dividend Company.” On a net income basis, it can look underwhelming. But when you look at its FFO and AFFO, it becomes obvious why investors prize its dividend reliability. On the other hand, watch out for REITs that trumpet high FFO but constantly issue shares or take on debt just to cover CapEx—they might look like cash cows but are actually cash traps.\n\n**d. Normalized FCF during Bubbles - A great tool**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nUsing normalized FCF during Bubbles is very helpful because you know exactly how to value the company in a situation where the bubble pops and CapEx drops significantly (because that shiny new tech/trend no longer matters to investors). A company may have almost identical FCF during and after a bubble and during the popping of a bubble, multiples contract considerably, and so this type of company will be left out to rot in the stock market. But, on the other hand, companies like GOOG that have very high temporary AI CapEx could easily cut back on this spending and have a much higher FCF in a short time, therefore counteracting the multiples contraction.\n\nPractical Example:\n\nI posted a recent article on the 2025 AI bubble where I gave a few examples of what valuations companies would deserve in a no-bubble scenario. Check it out [here](https://deepvalueanalysis.substack.com/p/beyond-the-ai-hype-analysing-market).\n\n# A.2. Lessons about the Value Investor Mindset\n\n**a. Roughly Two main types of Investments**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nThere are two main types of investments based on sound analysis and that meet the Benjamin Graham definition of an investment and not speculation:  \n1. ***Cigar Butt/Deep Value Play***\n\n2. ***Buffett Play***\n\n**The Cigar Butt/Deep Value Play** is mostly when you find an extremely undervalued company at a good MOS (>30%) and that has little to no future growth prospects. These are meant to be sold at fair value, or slightly above, usually giving a quick 50-70% profit. (In most cases they also give a big dividend so the total return is closer to 75%).\n\n**The Buffett Play** can be done at or below fair value, but it has to be a very high quality company with an impenetrable moat and good future growth prospects. These can be held “**forever**”. They are to be sold only when there is an extreme bubble (trading >2.5 times fair value), when the moat is in danger, or when there is a serious personal need for money.\n\nPractical Example:  \nCigar Butt - BTI (bought in at 29.3$ in May last year, and made +35% incl. Dividends, during the same time the S&P grew 3% incl. Dividends) - numbers given to exemplify a normal return for a cigar butt play.  \nA lot of REITS fall under Cigar Butt. My most recent REIT play was HIW (+80% in 1 year - basically the maximum realistic gain on a Cigar Butt in the current market)\n\nBuffett Play - AAPL, NFLX (2022-2025), MSFT (Post-2000 - Now), AMZN (Post-2000 - Now), AXP (1991-Now), etc.\n\n**b. Handling a >-30% drop**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nYou shouldn’t let emotions control your investments, after all, it’s just numbers. Almost **ALL** of my investments have gone in the red before becoming profitable. I could start talking for hours about how to control yourself, but the truth is that some people are just not ready to stomach a >30% loss. I’ve been there, and it’s very hard. Some like me learn from mistakes and can be transformed into someone who can stand these losses, there are also some who naturally tolerate them, but there is also a subset of investors who can’t handle them. To those investors I recommend automatic debit to an index fund account and to never look at it.\n\nPractical example:\n\nBeing -50% on a stock that you did a whole investment thesis on and wanting to pull your hairs out, but you resist selling, and after some time you start gaining: -30%, -20%, -5%, +5%, +30%. It’s a slow process but it happens, and at the end you’ve come out on top as a better investor who has just managed to control his emotions. Great Job!\n\n**c. Misinterpreting drops in price**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nPeople act on emotions and when they see a 20% drop in a week and a negative article on seeking alpha they believe that they made a bad investment. Trust me, if you do your DD and you understand the company, some random SA article or random drop shouldn’t scare you. I have learnt this from personal experience and the only way to pass this is to feel it for yourself several times to skip over the bullsh\\*t of Mr. Market.\n\nPractical Example:  \nNVDA end of 2022 - Great fundamentals but it was being battered by both Mr. Market and “Analysts” (most of them don’t deserve that title)\n\n**d. The “Cramer” Investors**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nDon’t invest based on ANYTHING you see being told on TV. IF Cramer told people to buy, don’t—unless you’ve done significant DD. As the saying goes—even a broken clock is right twice a day.\n\nPractical Example:  \nInverse Cramer… I am joking.\n\n**e. No such thing as “It has grown in the past, so it must continue to do so.”**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nAs the title says, past performance is almost never an indicator of future performance. A true investor’s indicator of future performance is an in-depth analysis.\n\nPractical Example:  \nAAPL has grown at a \\~27% CAGR in the past 20 years *so it must continue to do so*. - By that logic apple will have a higher market capitalization than all stock markets combined in 15 years.\n\n**f. When to sell - My mistakes**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nThis links back to the two main types of investments. If you catch a cigar butt, the answer is simple. Sell at or slightly above fair value. But, in the case of “Buffett” Plays , they are to be sold only when there is an extreme bubble (trading >2.5 times fair value), when the moat is in danger, or when there is a serious personal need for money. In other words, they can be held “forever”.\n\nPractical Example:  \nAXP, GOOG, KO, AAPL.\n\nMy mistakes:  \nI confused the two types of plays. I have sold companies at +60-80% gain instead of holding out for Multibaggers (x3-10-100). My biggest mistakes are NVDA (I missed out on a x12 by selling at x2), CAT (x1.7 instead of x3.5), TSM (x1.4 instead of x2.1), META (x1.5 instead of x4), etc.\n\n# B. My 7 Key Plays during 2022-2025\n\n# B.1. The Plays\n\n1. GOOG\n2. NFLX\n3. META\n4. JPM\n5. TSM\n6. AXP\n7. CAT\n\n# B.2. Why?\n\nAll of them had one thing in common. They were undervalued based on multiple metrics, they were great business with solid growth prospects, their drop in stock price was due to reasons other than a true change in the day-to-day reality of their business operations. - There is LITERALLY nothing more to add. It’s pretty simple, you don’t need extremely complex formulas.\n\nS&P 2022 ; -\\~20% - This is the year that stocks went on sale\n\nDuring 2022 I was buying heavily, especially NFLX, GOOG and MSFT which dropped much more than the S&P. My key plays in 2022 gave me some very HARD lessons on losing money temporarily. These investments weren’t merely some fundamental analysis combined with analyzing management (through checking past promises and targets and seeing if they line up with reality and results), they were a test in emotion management. Because USD appreciated compared to my national currency and these stocks dropped a lot, I saw -35% one morning and I didn’t know what to do, so I just went for a 17 KM Run in a nearby managed forest (sort of like a park) and I took a long shower with a short 1 min cold bath and I stopped overthinking about whether I should or shouldn’t sell—in the following 3 months I recovered all my losses.\n\n# C. Similarities and Differences to 2022\n\n# C.1. Similarities\n\n**a. Tech Bubble**\n\nBoth in 2020-2021 and now there is a clear tech bubble, where multiples have expanded considerably, and now sit well above the historical averages. Of course, the reason (the motive for the bubble) is different. Moreover, the 2020-2021 bubble popped in 2022, and the 2024 bubble is slowly popping in 2025 (at least for now, it’s not impossible for it to reverse course).\n\n**b. Russian Aggression**\n\nThe Russo-Ukrainian war started on the 24th of February 2022 and it caused a widespread reaction throughout the world. It led to inflation, lower GDP growth in Europe, started recession fears in the US, etc.\n\nThe war is still ongoing and it is part of the Trump agenda, so it is still important, although its effects on the rest of the world have considerably died down.\n\n# C.2. Differences\n\n**a. Trump Tariffs**\n\nAlthough there were already tariffs on China, which Biden continued, they weren’t even close to the current scale. As of the time of writing, the tariffs stand at [145%](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/12/economy/toy-prices-us-china-tariffs/index.html). These are going to have a negative impact on inflation, the economy and the US’s status as a reliable trading partner. These are long term concerns that have immediate implications which may cause the US to go into a recession, or at least a bear market.\n\n**b. European “Trump Card”**\n\nTrump winning the election has definitely changed the trajectory of Europe and I believe that the EU is starting to wake up (although very slowly). Von der Leyen has until now [mostly delivered](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-first-100-days-graded-europe-nato-ukraine-war/) on her promises (first 100 days), which is much better than in the past. And all of her promises for the next 4 years give European stocks an ability to decouple from the us stock market performance (Capital markets union, defense union, deregulation, 28th regime, etc.), so you can find some interesting opportunities on the European markets as well.\n\n# D. 2025 - Value Ideas/Plays\n\n# D.1. Key Sector - Hidden Normalized FCF\n\nTech is hiding a lot of normalized FCF under its hood. I’ve already done an article on this topic and I’ve placed it 👇.\n\n\n\n# D.2. Similar Plays\n\nGOOG looks pretty interesting, although they have some problems with monopoly law, which should be kept in mind when doing DD. As for the rest of the 2025 plays, I believe we should still wait a bit more for them to drop, but in general most of the great plays are in tech, just like last time. (Don’t expect me to give you what stocks to invest in, I am not a guru)\n\n# D.3. New Boring Value (eg. BTI)\n\nBTI is my most recent cigar butt play and it demonstrates that “boring” value still exists in the market. Even in overvalued markets, you can still find value, you just have to build a keen sense of smell and have some patience. With the market dropping after Trump’s tariffs, I believe new boring value will appear, but the question is—should you choose to put your money in a quick cigar butt play or in a long term Buffett play?\n\n# E. Conclusion\n\nFocusing on true cash flow metrics and disciplined analysis is essential for investment success. Ignore market noise, understand company fundamentals, and manage emotions. Whether seeking quick value or long-term growth, patience and adaptability are the keys to strong returns.",

        "selftext": "Currently, NVIDIA ($NVDA) is the market leader, with a market cap reaching $3T, surpassing Microsoft ($MSFT) and nearing Apple ($AAPL). The main question on investors’ minds is, \"How much higher will it grow from here?\" \n\nHowever, there is a sense of nervousness in the air. NVIDIA’s stock has been declining since their fantastic earnings call. The reason, according to investors, is that its gross margin decreased from 78.4% to 75.1% quarter-over-quarter, with some of this decline attributed to issues in Blackwell chip manufacturing. Today, the stock further impacted the market by dropping 10%, wiping out $279 billion in market capitalization. \n\nAfter hours, two reports surfaced that shed light on the decline (whales likely knew and sold beforehand):\n\n1. A mystery customer, potentially Microsoft, accounted for 19% of Nvidia’s revenue last year, according to UBS (reported by Business Insider).\n\n2. Nvidia received a DOJ subpoena as part of an escalating antitrust probe, with subpoenas also sent to third parties in the case.\n\n[NVIDIA Performance Screenshot 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dMbKkf4OkbkZeQ9dxWuUHXn1e7iPCVxe/view?usp=share_link)\n\n[NVIDIA Performance Screenshot 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Td85sBZQMidroWUbn-2cqpH7jmKr64V4/view?usp=share_link)\n\nBased on NVIDIA’s ($NVDA) 10-Q, the company was already concerned about those two key issues: customer concentration and the risk of regulation.\n\nQuote from NVIDIA’s 10-Q:\n\n>\"We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors. We have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\"\n\n>[NVIDIA 10-Q Quote screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12PJkQCvHxgBzimNj1pUcGKeulBTNSSaP/view?usp=share_link)\n\n\n\nIf the company was already concerned about these issues, it means the risks are very real. \n\nIf the risk is real, and you hold NVIDIA ($NVDA), you have to ask yourself how to position yourself.\n\nHere are some important questions to consider:\n\n1 - Do you believe NVIDIA will become the first company to cross $4T in market cap despite these very real risks?\n\nThe answer is: we don’t know, but it’s not looking good.\n\n2 - Which company stands to benefit from an antitrust probe in the AI accelerator space?\n\n\n\n**A - Is it Intel ($INTC)? Probably not.** \n\nThis is a company that just laid off 15,000 employees and is losing money hand over fist, even with significant government subsidies (up to $8.5 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act, with an additional $11 billion in loans).\n\nAs of this writing, Intel is reportedly considering selling its Foundry business, which has been hemorrhaging money.\n\nRecent performance:\n\n• Q2 Revenue = $12.8 billion, down ⬇️ 1% YoY, up ⬆️ 1% QoQ\n\n• DCAI (Data Center and AI) – Revenue was flat sequentially and down 3% YoY (less revenue than last year ☹️)\n\n• The operating loss for the Intel Foundry business was $2.8 billion in Q2 2024, compared to $1.9 billion in Q2 2023. Year-to-date 2024, the operating loss was $5.3 billion, compared to $4.2 billion YTD 2023.\n\n[Intel Performance Screenshot -1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jmwqQa_Xo-CO0oCUenG3VrsC3GL9yNUf/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Intel Performance Screenshot -2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13dERGSZKxftrZ5IbKYiOcyVtRZXd8wrZ/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Intel Performance Screenshot -3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTjWq6djgA8UaHUsCC1GZL0MMM2oP69i/view?usp=sharing)\n\n  \n**B - Is it AMD ($AMD)? Maybe, or even probably.** \n\nLet’s take a look at the metrics:\n\n• Data Center: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year, driven by growth in AMD Instinct GPUs and EPYC server revenue, with a 21% QoQ increase.\n\nUnlike Intel, AMD is actually generating revenue from AI through its GPU and data center business.\n\nCurrently, AMD is valued at $221.63 billion. Is it overvalued? That’s hard to say. Is NVIDIA overvalued?\n\nTo wrap up, it’s clear that AMD still has room to grow.\n\n[AMD Performance Screenshot - 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y9Qd3O6P9oIZJCOwDPsV00v9AzkiBHCu/view?usp=sharing)\n\n  \n",

        "selftext": "holy shit this is long, will make another post about what I'm buying later\n\nI'm not usually this active but the valuation expansion in my portfolio is getting uncomfortable. I would love to be a high-conviction all-in on 1-3 stocks (like the HSY guy) but I don't think I can stomache it, maybe with some more experience. For now I tend to diversify over about 10-20 companies to protect myself from my own ignorance.\n\n# Selling\n\n* Disney (DIS) - I bought it primarily for its streaming business, with the parks and production segments as a stable foundation. I don't hate it don't love it, I just want to put money elsewhere. Management shuffling gives me lack of confidence, wall st likes Bob Igor but who knows how long he'll want to stick around. IMO he's not the right person to grow streaming, and neither was he previous successor. I don't know enough about the movie industry or parks to be invested in it.\n\n* Apple (AAPL) - A great company with great products, I've owned for years but EPS has been flat for the past 3 years. Last 2 years have been nothing but valuation expansion which is a good enough reason for me to trim/sell. They capitalize their R&D expenses (as they should according to GAAP) but it means their IRR (ROIC) which looks the same as other Mag7 companies (that don't capitalize R&D) is actually worse. They also have an outsized exposure to chinese trade risk. I think there are better opportunities at my meager scale. May pick back up if it goes down by 30% but I can't justify it in my portfolio at its current yields.\n\n# Reducing\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) - Similar to AAPL, except it still grows. Increasingly I don't like retail and its margins. AMZN is huge and retail margins are such that they need to go into negative cash flow to make any major investments. Their most recent investment in improving the logistics has worked out well (gj Jassy), arguably an impenetrable logistics moat. AWS is *the* leader but I think Azure has the better growth prospects, AWS cannabalizes its 3rd party vendors to grow which I don't think is very sustainable. Their ROIC isn't amazing and not managining dilution well. People have all sorts of rationalizations about why you shouldn't look at their ROIC, earnings or FCF because of how they do internal investments, but idc. It will probably do fine in the coming years, but if it turned into an IBM in 10-20 years I wouldn't be at all surprised. Not that IBM is a terrible company, I just can't justify its (or AMZN's) price right now, you do you.\n\n# Undecided - to sell\n\n* Warner Bros (WBD) - Bought primarily for its streaming business, recent restructure is promising but may also indicate a spin-off or selling of part of their business. If I could buy the streaming business on its own I would, as it is I have to take it together with its production segments that I can't properly value. It's cashflow basically comes from the depreciation of intangible assets. It's hard to know exactly what that refers to but other than film and tv content rights (which are itemized separately) it probably means network or dtc distribution agreements of sorts (maybe, idk). So it's far from being in a sustainable place. Probably going to exit next quarter depending on what happens with the reorg.\n\n# Unchanged\n\nMore than half of my portfolio is still Meta + Google which I'm not looking to change for the forseeable future. There's a lot that can be said about each and their respective competitive landscape, but the tldr is that their 30%+ ROIC (which is actually higher because they don't capitalize R&D), consistent profitability, eps growth and strong balance sheets justifies their price to me.",

Got me thinking: if stocks go sideways but earnings keep growing at the normal 6-8% per year, how long before valuations look normal again?\n\nDid the math and it's about 5-7 years of sideways action while earnings compound. Take Apple for example - they're at a P/E of 31 vs their historical 20 ([https://valuesense.io/ticker/aapl](https://valuesense.io/ticker/aapl)). If their stock price freezes but earnings keep growing at 10% annually, they'd be back to normal in about 4.5 years. Pretty wild, right?\n\nSome analysts are actually projecting 15% earnings growth for 2025, which would speed things up, but who knows with all these tariff threats and policy chaos floating around. Plus, let's be real - the market is basically 7 mega-cap tech companies (making up \\~30% of the index) and then everything else. Strip those out, and the rest of the market actually looks way more reasonably priced.\n\nI keep seeing this argument that we've got more retail investors than ever pumping money into the market, especially with how easy apps make it to invest now. Is this really creating a \"new normal\" for P/E ratios? Or is this just the same old \"this time it's different\" BS we always hear at market peaks?\n\nEven if no 20-year period has ever produced negative returns, a market that goes nowhere for 5+ years is still terrible for anyone buying in now. You're basically just losing to inflation the whole time.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

Elon Musk’s xAI released their version just days later with their newest Grok 3 reasoning model.\n\nAnd I’m no better than these copycat companies because I released a Deep Research alternative for EXTREMELY advanced, comprehensive financial analysis.\n\n# What’s the idea behind “Deep Research”?\n\nThe key idea behind Deep Research is laziness. Instead of doing the work to create a comprehensive report on a topic, you just use an LLM, and it will compile the report autonomously.\n\nUnlike the traditional usage of large language models, this process is somewhat asynchronous.\n\nWith it, you give deep research an extremely complex task, and then it will spend the next 2 to 20 minutes “thinking” and generating a report for your question.\n\nFor example, if we look at the comparison between GPT-4o and Deep Research, we can see that deep research creates a comprehensive report on iOS vs Android adoption rates over the past 10 years.\n\n[Pic: Deep Research page on the OpenAI website](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*UnNkEqvwTlip25dg4AKZ2Q.png)\n\nThis allows us to do hours of work within minutes. So being an algorithmic trader, I KNEW I had to make a Deep Research alternative for advanced stock analysis.\n\n# How would Deep Research be useful for stock analysis?\n\nIf you're a savvy investor, you already know the types of things that goes into comprehensive financial analysis. This includes:\n\n* Thoroughly reviewing income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows from 10-Q and 10-K reports\n* Real-time sentiment analysis of recent company news\n* Monitoring trading volumes and stock price fluctuations\n* Analyzing similar companies or a company’s closest competitors\n\nDoing all of this one after the other is ridiculously time-consuming. Hell, I might as well just invest in SPY and call it a day; I mean, who has time for all of that? But imagine… just close your eyes and *imagine* if you could click a button and get ALL of the information you could ever need about a stock.\n\nNow open your eyes and keep following along because now we literally can.\n\n# Introducing NexusTrade Deep Dive (DD)\n\nI named the alternative to Deep Research “DD” for a specific reason. In investing, when you do research on a stock, we call that doing your due diligence. Now DD has a new meaning.\n\nDeep Dive is a one-click solution to performing some of the most advanced due diligence from an AI model. With a single button click, you get a comprehensive report that:\n\n* Analyzes recent price trends and possible anomalies\n* Examine financial metrics for the past 4 years and the past 4 quarters\n* Interprets recent news and the possible impact on the stock price\n* Conducts a comprehensive SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)\n\nFor example, let’s say I’m an AI enthusiast interested in NVIDIA stock. NVIDIA recently fell after its earnings, and I’m wondering if it’s a good idea to lower my cost average or bail on the play.\n\nTraditional stock analysis would take hours. I would have to Google the stock, read news articles about it, look at their earnings statements, find their competitors, and finally come to a decision.\n\nBut now, here’s the DD on NVIDIA. Powered by AI. [And here’s the PDF of the document, which you can download after generating a report.](https://nexustrade-prod.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/NVDA_DeepResearch_Report.pdf)\n\n[The DD report on NVIDIA (downloadable in NexusTrade)](https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https%3A//nexustrade-prod.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/NVDA_DeepResearch_Report.pdf&embedded=true)\n\n# NVIDIA’s Deep Dive (DD) powered by NexusTrade\n\n[Pic: A PDF of NexusTrade’s Deep Dive Report](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*EUpyqQ8B_NIISmaOthtAGg.png)\n\n**Report Summary**\n\nWith the click of a button, we have this comprehensive PDF report on NVIDIA. It starts with an **executive summary**. This summary explains the entire report, and gives an **investment thesis** that explains why someone might want to hold the stock. Finally, it concludes, risk rating for the stock and a detailed explanation for why it was given that.\n\n**Price Performance Analysis**\n\nAfter the executive summary comes the **price performance analysis.** This section gives us recent price information about NVIDIA for the last 4 years. We can see how NVIDIA has moved recently, and it’s overall trend in price movement.\n\n[Pic: Seeing NVIDIA’s change in price and technical analysis insights](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*sq_DJqzwyLNdvQ7o-m_uLA.png)\n\nThis is cool. For example, while we might be bummed that NVIDIA hasn’t moved much in the past 3 months, we’re reminded that it has moved a ridiculous amount in the past few years. This is always a great reminder for investors holding the stock.\n\n**Fundamental Analysis**\n\nHowever, what’s more interesting than the price analysis is the fundamental analysis. With this section, we get to understanding exactly how strong and healthy the stock’s underlying business actually is.\n\nWe start by looking at its quarter-over-quarter and annual performance.\n\n[Pic: Looking at the financial performance of NVIDIA stock](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*AqChgo-B2mI4sOVOblXt5w.png)\n\nThis is useful to understand the company’s financial stability, liquidity position, and overall fiscal health.\n\n[Pic: Looking at the cash flow of NVIDIA](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*wASGx3fkgVTtSDyIv2ADLg.png)\n\nWith this, we’re not just trading stocks; we’re buying shares of a business, and this information helps us decide if the business is worth investing in or not.\n\nAfter this, we get to another fun section – comparing the stock to its biggest competitors.\n\n# Competitive Comparison\n\n[Pic: Comparing NVIDIA to its peers](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lJ29ivB0tIjdBC1c9zV4XQ.png)\n\nAfter analyzing the fundamentals of NVIDIA, we also analyze some of its biggest industry peers. In this case, we’re analyzing AMD, Broadcom, Intel, Microsoft, Google, and Meta.\n\nWe have a very nice, readable chart that compares key metrics, such as revenue growth, net margin, ROE, P/E ratio, and more. With this, we can quickly see why NVIDIA rose to a $3 trillion market cap. When we compare it to other stocks like AMD, its extremely clear which one is fundamentally stronger and has a lower valuation.\n\nAfter we’re done looking at NVIDIA’s fundamentals, we can then explore its sentiment, and why it has been in the news recently.\n\n# Recent News Analysis\n\n[Pic: Looking at the recent news for NVIDIA](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*9YHQPcNy7nnKoFZSbh1r9A.png)\n\nAfter examining NVIDIA’s fundamentals and comparing it to competitors, the next crucial section is the News Analysis. This section provides valuable context about recent events that could impact the stock’s performance.\n\nIn the case of NVIDIA, we can see that the DD report analyzes recent news coverage, including earnings reports, CEO statements, and market reactions. This analysis helps investors understand the narrative surrounding the company and how it might influence investor sentiment and stock price.\n\nFor example, the report highlights NVIDIA’s strong Q4 FY2025 performance with 78% year-over-year revenue growth, as well as CEO Jensen Huang’s comments about next-generation AI requiring significantly more computing power. These insights provide forward-looking indicators of potential demand growth for NVIDIA’s products.\n\nNews analysis is essential because markets often react to headlines before fully digesting the underlying fundamentals. By examining recent news systematically, investors can separate signal from noise and make more informed decisions.\n\n# Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats Section\n\n[Pic: The SWAT section for the article](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*0xm6gt7MbTHCogVPap8fkg.png)\n\nOne of the most comprehensive parts of the DD report is the SWOT analysis, which provides a structured framework for evaluating NVIDIA’s competitive position:\n\nThe Strengths section highlights NVIDIA’s dominant market position (like its 80–90% market share in AI accelerators), exceptional financial performance (114.20% annual revenue growth), and technological leadership with its GPU architectures.\n\nThe Weaknesses section acknowledges potential vulnerabilities, including dependency on the AI boom, premium valuation that leaves little margin for error, and the impact of export controls on NVIDIA’s China business.\n\nThe Opportunities section identifies growth areas such as expanding AI applications, automotive growth, and enterprise AI adoption across industries.\n\nThe Threats section outlines challenges like intensifying competition from AMD, Intel, and startups, regulatory challenges, and potential macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nThis SWOT analysis is invaluable for investors because it moves beyond raw financial data to provide strategic context. It helps answer the crucial question of whether a company’s competitive advantages are sustainable, and what factors could disrupt its business model in the future.\n\n# Conclusion and Investment Outlook\n\nThe final section ties everything together with a forward-looking investment recommendation. This holistic summary helps investors understand whether all the data points to a compelling investment case.\n\nFor NVIDIA, the report concludes with a balanced perspective: strong fundamentals support the company’s premium valuation, but investors should remain aware of risks like competition, regulatory challenges, and the company’s vulnerability to geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe report provides a 12-month price target range ($135-$160) and a risk rating (Medium), giving investors concrete parameters to guide their decision-making. This clear assessment is what makes Deep Dive reports so valuable compared to traditional stock research methods.\n\n# Why Deep Dive Analysis Matters\n\nWhat makes the Deep Dive approach revolutionary is its comprehensiveness and efficiency. Traditional fundamental analysis requires investors to spend hours gathering information from multiple sources — financial statements, news articles, competitive analysis, and technical charts. The DD report consolidates all this information into a single, coherent document that can be generated in minutes.\n\nFor retail investors who lack the time or resources to conduct exhaustive research, this democratizes access to high-quality financial analysis. It provides a structured framework for evaluating stocks beyond simple metrics like P/E ratios or revenue growth.\n\nAs AI continues to transform the financial industry, tools like NexusTrade’s Deep Dive represent the future of investment research — comprehensive, data-driven, and accessible with a single click. Whether you’re evaluating established giants like NVIDIA or researching promising newcomers, the DD framework provides the structured analysis needed to make informed investment decisions in today’s complex market environment.\n\nBy turning hours of research into minutes of reading, Deep Dive analysis doesn’t just save time — it fundamentally changes how investors can approach due diligence in the age of AI.\n\nWant to try Deep Dive for yourself?

        "title": "Deepseek’s Impact on FAANG+: A Value Investor’s Perspective",
        "selftext": "**Microsoft (MSFT)** \n\nMicrosoft is by far the biggest buyer of NVIDIA chips thanks to its OpenAI partnership – which also makes it the most exposed to the DeepSeek open-source model release. Commoditization (and dirt-cheap pricing) of these models directly undermines OpenAI’s value proposition and the existing infrastructure Microsoft’s built. The stock could drop sharply, especially if users flee OpenAI for free alternatives like DeepSeek, jeopardizing their joint venture. Remember: Microsoft’s $10B OpenAI investment relies on profit-sharing to pay off, and that math gets trickier as AI becomes commoditized.That said, all isn’t lost. Satya Nadella – the *King of Open Source* – has pivoted Microsoft brilliantly before. His playbook? Embrace, don’t fight, the wave. A few examples: **Bottom line**: Nadella understands open source’s power better than anyone. While Microsoft’s heavy OpenAI/Infra bets look shaky short-term, Azure could pivot to dominate the *commoditized* AI future. They’re poised to offer open-source models as APIs (like \"R1\" or others) and integrate cheaper, leaner models into their own products – slashing costs while keeping enterprise customers hooked.Short-term? MSFT might stumble if OpenAI falters. Long-term? Azure becomes the *Walmart of AI models* – lower margins, but massive volume. Any stock dip here is a buying opportunity.\n\n   * Dumping Internet Explorer for Chromium-based Edge\n   * Open-sourcing Visual Studio Code (now the #1 developer IDE)\n   * GitHub Copilot: Originally OpenAI-powered, but Satya wisely expanded it to support Anthropic’s models too, making it more versatile.\n\n**Alphabet (GOOGL)**\n\nGoogle’s search business faces daily threats from AI startups like OpenAI, Perplexity, and DeepSeek – all offering competing search tools. This is *very* bearish for the stock, especially if user attrition accelerates. Alphabet bought fewer NVIDIA chips than other hyperscalers, leaning instead on its cost-effective TPU ASICs and in-house AI models. But their late, botched rollout in the AI race left their models lagging behind DeepSeek and OpenAI in popularity. Even their Gemini lineup hasn’t sparked much developer excitement.\n\nThe silver lining? Google’s scrambling to catch up. They’re integrating AI responses directly into search results – a move that risks cannibalizing search ad revenue but could help retain users. Their ad network remains unmatched (thanks to cash cows like AdSense, AdMob, YouTube and Gmail, which aren’t threatened by AI… yet). Right now, Google’s survival hinges on keeping users glued to its ecosystem *at all costs*.\n\nLong-term, I’m cautious – particularly on their ad business. I’ll be watching search revenue trends like a hawk to gauge if the stock’s worth buying. That said, Alphabet’s entrenched ad dominance means any short-term, panic-driven sell-off could be a golden chance to scoop up shares. \n\n**Amazon (AMZN)**\n\nAmazon is known for doubling down on \"frugal\" culture – they’re all about doing more with less, cutting fluff, and pushing self-reliance (it’s literally one of their leadership principles). That’s why this DeepSeek R1 news makes sense for AWS adoption since it was trained at a fraction of the cost. Don’t forget, Amazon is already making their own AI chips – Trainium (training) and Inferentia (inference) – which screams efficiency and capital discipline. Plus, AWS could host not just Amazon’s proprietary models but also serve up open-source options like R1. In the long-term, I am bullish. Short-term, there might be a negligible bearish sentiment about their Anthropic investment looking shaky against DeepSeek. \n\n**Tesla (TSLA)**\n\nTesla might see a small correction too, but not because of DeepSeek – their business and AI focus are totally different. If you think about it, this is actually bullish for Tesla, especially if NVIDIA ends up slashing GPU prices. Tesla could get way more bang for their buck. \n\n**Meta Platforms (META)**\n\nMeta’s the biggest winner in this whole debacle. Their goal with releasing open-source Llama models was always to commoditize AI and avoid getting left behind in case of a breakthrough. Well, DeepSeek just delivered that breakthrough. There’s speculation that R1 is already better than the upcoming Llama 4 model. Now, Meta gets to release an even better open-source model that they can also use internally. While all this sounds bullish for Meta, investors still haven’t seen clear revenue signals from all this Capex. Long-term, if tangible revenue doesn’t materialize, investors might sell the stock – just like they did in the past with all the metaverse Capex. Overall, I’m neutral on Meta in the short term but slightly bullish in the long term.\n\n**Apple (AAPL)**\n\nAs you know, Apple’s execution in the AI field has been downright underwhelming. The company faces its own problems, like slumping iPhone sales in China. On top of that, Apple is the least aggressive spender in this sector – no crazy AI investments reported, no partnership with NVIDIA for training their models. They are even renting cheaper Google Cloud TPUs instead of building their own infrastructure. So any Apple correction tied to this news would likely be minimal or unrelated. That said, the stock could dip broadly due to negative market sentiment. I’m staying NEUTRAL for now – but if we get an overdone sell-off? I would eye it as a BUY.\n\n[Read full article here...](https://www.stockstrends.ai/p/is-deepseek-a-signal-of-the-top-for)",

        "title": "$CART Stock is a Compounding Machine - Here’s Why",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone, the following analysis is one I actually wrote back in January but I feel it’s still relevant today. Instacart is an incredible business and I’ve been surprised I haven’t heard anything about it from other investors. All I ask is that you read with an open mind, thank you.\n\n\nMaplebear (Instacart) (CART)\n\nInstacart can be classified as an exponential compounding company. This company has impressed me over and over with its incredible resilience in the face of apparent mounting competition and its ability to produce precipitously growing yet consistent free cash flow (FCF) per share. Let's take a look at the qualities of this business and what exactly will make it outperform the market over the long term.\n\nMoat: When I’m looking to purchase a business I ask myself “Will this business get stronger in times of crises?”. Instacart was a business that in the most recent crises that was Covid-19 certainly got stronger, the company gained market share, expanded margins, and grew at a steep rate. In a time where people were fearful of leaving their home, Instacart was perfectly positioned to capitalize by delivering people the vital things they needed while also providing brick and mortar retailers with the resources they needed to serve customers. \nIn terms of the business’s moat, I would describe it as being an “Additive Layer”. So what is an Additive Layer in the context of this company's moat? As mentioned previously, Instacart offers products to traditional brick and mortar retail companies to help them enhance their businesses such as E-Commerce Solutions, Fulfillment Solutions, Connective Store Technology, and Advertising Solutions. When a traditional brick and mortar retailer utilizes even just one of these products (but oftentimes more than one product) it becomes part of their business, it offers so much new value to these very traditional businesses that they can't live without it. This appealing value proposition from Instacart makes its enterprise software extremely sticky. On the Q3 2024 earnings call Instacart CEO Fidji Simo cited the integration of Instacart technology into other businesses as a hugely influential factor to Instacart's future growth when she said “These integrations remain one of the most under-appreciated parts of our business and are really our secret sauce”. Right there in the earnings call the CEO is calling out the businesses ability to entrench itself in another business as being “under-appreciated” which is a key indicator of undervaluation by investors.\n\nYield: Assuming a 10-year risk free rate of 5% from the U.S. Treasury, we can use this 5% rate as a benchmark to value Instacart. The closer Instacart's free cash flow yield is to 5% then the greater the possibility that the company could be at a reasonable valuation. As of January 9th, 2024 Instacart's free cash flow yield adjusted for the 51.08% in dilutive Stock Based Compensation (SBC) is 2.96%. This yield is nothing spectacular but if you were to ignore the very real expense of SBC then the free cash flow yield shoots up to 6.05%. Now of course I’m not suggesting SBC can be ignored but if we take a look at Instacart's Q3 2024 earnings call we see that Instacart's CFO Emily Reuter had said “In Q4, we also anticipate SBC will begin to normalize now that we have lapped our IPO quarter”. So the management is directly telling us that SBC will continue a downward trend and judging from the SBC difference between Q2 of 2024 of 465.37% and Q3 of 2024 of 51.08% I feel strongly that we will continue to see a normalization of SBC. Assuming the current SBC is cut in half next quarter (a conservative estimate) and FCF has zero growth (extremely unlikely) then that would make the SBC adjusted FCF yield 4.50%, an extremely attractive number for such a great company and that's without the share buybacks of which Instacart will continue to be aggressive with implementing. So even though the current SBC on paper is 2.96%, we can make a safe estimate that it's actually closer to 4.50% and likely much higher. In the long term I expect Instacart's SBC to normalize to the high single digits and stay relatively stable apart from small variations (low to mid-single digit percentage differences) every Q2 due to the timing of Instacarts annual equity refresh grants.\n\n\nGrowth: With a 2 year average trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue growth rate of 20.56% and a 1 year average TTM growth rate of 10.08% Instacart has proven it has the ability to provide attractive revenue growth. Although revenue growth isn’t necessarily one of the most important factors in a business it is one worthy of being considered. What I see as arguably the most important factor in valuing a stock is the growth of FCF per share. This is the most important factor because it can tell us how much cash the business produces that can be readily distributed back to shareholders through buybacks and/or dividends. Instacart has grown its FCF per share at a dizzying rate of 100% over the past TTM, likewise the stock has risen 95.12% in the past year, an almost perfect match, this is a trend you’ll see in almost all public companies. I expect the FCF per share growth to continue at a less precipitous but still impressive rate for the foreseeable future due to Instacart's ability to produce abundant and growing amounts of FCF, their ongoing aggressive buyback program, and shrinking levels of SBC. The rate at which Instacart has returned capital over the past year has been truly astounding. In Q3 of 2023 they had a total of 0$ in share repurchases and only a year later in Q3 of 2024 they had completed a total of $3.297 Billion with the amount of repurchases rising steeply each quarter. \n\nCapital Efficiency: The capital efficiency of a company is a crucial key to assessing the viability of a company. A company’s efficiency is measured by its return on capital employed (ROCE). You want a company to have a ROCE of over 8%. Any company with a ROCE annual percentage under 8% is a capital destroyer.\nExcluding the yet to be reported Q4 of 2024, Instacart so far has a ROCE in 2024 of 10.85% and this figure will almost certainly rise when the final quarter of the year is reported. This percentage is more than adequate and tells me that the management of Instacart can be counted on to utilize its capital efficiently. It’s worthy of note that Instacart had a one time drastic decrease in ROCE in Q3 of 2023 to -65.73% due solely to its initial public offering (IPO), the quarter after this decrease ROCE returned to normal levels. As Instacart continues to scale and integrate itself into other businesses I expect to see the ROCE levels rise gradually over time.\n\n\n\nMargins: Instacart has impressively high gross margins, in Q3 of 2024 Instacart had a gross margin of 75.23%, that's higher than companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG),(GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The average gross \nmargin for public companies across all industries is 36%, so Instacart has over double the average gross margin. In addition to its extremely high gross margin, Instacart has also been growing this margin at an impressive and steady rate, in Q1 of 2021 the gross margin was 65.5%, representing some very impressive growth. This gross margin growth has also been relatively steady with small ebbs and flows overtime but continuing the relative uptrend. With an operating margin of 16.2% and a profit margin of 13.85%, (both of which are above average relative to all industries) this is yet another fundamental metric that Instacart continues to excel in. I expect to see gross margin, operating margin, and profit margin expand overtime gradually as the business continues to grow.\n\n\nBalance Sheet: Instacart is in an extremely strong financial position with $1.44 billion in cash, $28 million in capital leases, and just $16 million in debt. Even if you were to consider capital leases debt that still leaves Instacart in great financial shape. Since Instacart has so much cash from its operations just sitting around, we’ve seen them funneling this cash into aggressive share buybacks in the past few quarters and have likewise seen that cash position fall gradually. Instacart has never held large amounts of capital leases or debt which tells me the management can be trusted to properly manage the companies finances.\n\nExpenses: Instacart's overall expenses in any given normal operating quarter has remained modest, that being said from Q3 of 2023 to Q2 of 2024 expenses as a whole were elevated with the biggest acceleration in R&D (Research & Development). These sustained levels of increased expenses were due solely to impacts from Instacart's IPO and have normalized as of Q3 of 2024. The most important expenses I try to keep an eye out for are Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and R&D. Normally I like to see both R&D and CAPEX making up only a small percentage of the company’s market cap, in this case the sum of both expenses makes up only 6.24% of the current market cap, a good number for this company. Coming from the perspective of someone that generally looks for asset light companies with limited R&D and CAPEX spending, Instacart looks to be a solid investable candidate. \n\nCompetition: Like almost every company in the world Instacart faces competition. Although Instacart does face intense competition mainly from big, established companies like Uber (UBER) and Doordash (DASH, I believe Instacart has key advantages and qualities that uniquely position it to prosper. Overall Instacart has better margins, better rates of ROCE, better history of returning capital back to shareholders, a better balance sheet, and revenue growth on par with that of Uber (UBER). But more importantly I’ve seen how Instacart has entrenched itself in brick and mortar retail companies, creating a more effective ecosystem and therefore creating more value for these retailers.\n\nKey Takeaways: At its core I believe Instacart's future will be reliant not necessarily on grocery delivery but on its ability to integrate itself and more importantly its technology into the brick and mortar retail market. This integration will come in the form of both software solutions like Carrot AI and physical solutions like Caper Carts. The Integration will also come in the form of direct partnerships with popular retailers, we’ve seen this taking place for some time as Instacart has partnered with companies like Shoprite and Costco (COST). Overall, I believe Instacart to be a company with unique qualities that will continue to be a compounding machine into the foreseeable future and will continue to return cash flows back to investors at a vigorous rate.\n",

        "selftext": "A small writen piece on the crash cource of the Stock Exchanges : [HERE](https://andreevdan.substack.com/p/background-the-business-of-exchanges?r=4klyy7)\n\nPRE-INTRODUCTION\n\nHello again. It's lovely to see that I have not lost all of you! This next project was meant as a single short write-up on the great monopolistic business of stock exchanges. To introduce the topic, this crash course of sorts would cover the topics of history, the types of exchanges, the business models, the variety, the regulatory framework, differences around the world, etc. However, as I started putting pen to paper, the piece got very long and gained a life of its own. Therefore, I decided to break the work into multiple pieces instead of narrowing it down and sacrificing valuable explanations for those exploring these topics for the first time. For those already familiar with the topic, feel free to open the section that interests you or await for the next write-up (on a specific exchange coming soon!), For the rest of you, I will try my best not to lose you all. I will try to explain it, bring relatable examples, and keep it shortish. P.S. A full PDF can be found HERE. Sections can be found in the PDF:\n\n1. Introduction\n2. What is an Exchange & Instruments\n3. History\n4. Major Players\n5. Exchange Options\n6. Business Models\n7. Conclusions\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI believe we are fortunate to be living in the 21st century with access to capital markets. Every day, there are trillions of dollars worth of transactions that flow through the world's exchanges. Money flows from one pair of hands to another, changing ownership of assets in what is truly the epitome of capitalism: the exchange, the single most influential entry for business. \n\nThese marketplaces sit at the very heart of our economic system. They help capitalism work by connecting those who need capital with those who have it to invest. They fund businesses, allow everybody to participate in the miracle of capitalism, and give everyone a chance at ownership of the best assets humanity has created. \n\nAs Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once observed, the stock market has evolved to become a window into the economy itself. This powerful leading indicator reflects not just where we are but where we're collectively heading. It's no coincidence that economists, policymakers, and business leaders observe market movements carefully. The activity on the exchanges illustrates the aggregated opinion of all the participants who make billions of decisions a day. \n\nMost of us interact with these markets directly or indirectly. For example, our retirement funds are invested in stocks and bonds traded on these exchanges. University endowments, charitable foundations, pension funds, insurance companies – virtually all major financial institutions place significant portions of their capital in markets. There's a deep, fundamental relationship between these exchanges and the broader economy, each factor influencing the other in a complex dance that affects everyone. \n\nThese exchanges are the cornerstones of capitalism, the foundations upon which modern economies are built. Yet, how many of us have ever stopped to think: What is a stock exchange, really? How does it actually work? Do we need it? Who controls it? Does the government influence it? Following this train of thought, let's dive deeper into our curiosity about why we use exchanges at all. How do exchanges enable these massive, complex operations? How do the actual exchanges themselves make money? And did you know that many of these exchange operators are publicly traded companies that you can own? \n\nOver the next few write-ups, we're going to study the business of exchanges. We will try to build a foundation upon which we can uncover these secrets. We'll examine several of the publicly traded exchange operators and understand whether you should consider these amazing businesses for your own investment portfolio. \n\nIn the CliffsNotes version of this piece, I formulate the opinion that exchanges are fascinating businesses with characteristics Warren Buffett has always loved – wide moats (significant competitive advantage), network effects (think snowball rolling down a hill the bigger you get, the faster you roll), capital-light operations (doesn't need a lot of money to keep business running) and tollbooth-like economics (unavoidable fee collection). Once established, exchanges tend to enjoy natural monopolies or oligopolies, creating enduring competitive advantages. \n\nUnlike most businesses that must reinvent themselves to stay relevant, stock exchanges have existed for centuries while maintaining the same essential function: efficiently bringing buyers and sellers together. For example, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, founded in 1602, would be recognizable in purpose (if not in technology) to a modern trader on the New York Stock Exchange. \n\nWhat makes exchanges particularly interesting from an investment perspective is that they combine the stability of essential infrastructure with growth opportunities in new financial products, data services, and geographic expansion. They're positioned at the crossroads of nearly every major economic trend. \n\nSo join me as we explore this business that sits at the very foundation of our capitalist system – the business of making markets. We'll look at how exchanges evolved, how they operate today, how they make money, the regulatory frameworks they navigate, and ultimately, whether they might deserve a place in your portfolio. \n\nWhat is a an Exchange? \n\nAt its most basic level, an exchange is a marketplace where securities—stocks, bonds, options, futures, and other financial instruments (more on them in a bit)—are bought and sold. But unlike the farmer's market, where you can see the vegetables and haggle with the seller, exchanges deal in ownership rights that exist primarily as electronic records where you constantly have buyers and sellers exchanging at a price. \n\nFor example, when you see a stock price displayed on your screen, say, Apple (AAPL) at $212.53, what you're actually seeing is the price at which the last recorded public transaction transpired. This \"last price\" is simply a record of what someone was willing to pay and someone else was willing to accept for a share of Apple at a specific moment in time. The other prices you may see are bid and asks; \n - The bid is the highest price a buyer is currently willing to pay for a share \n - The ask (or offer) is the lowest price a seller is currently willing to accept \n - The difference between these two is called the spread \n\nThis spread might be just a penny for highly liquid (high number of transactions in a short time) stocks like Apple. It could be substantial for thinly traded stocks (stocks that change hands rarely). The exchanges maintain an \"order book\" that lists all the bids and asks, creating a marketplace where buyers and sellers meet. \n\nMajor Exchanges Around the World The world's stock exchanges vary enormously in size, with the largest dwarfing the smallest: \n\n - New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) - The world's largest exchange by market capitalisation, hosting over 2,300 companies valued at over $25 trillion. \n - NASDAQ - The second-largest exchange, home to many technology giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. \n - Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) - The largest in Asia, listing over 3,700 companies. \n - Shanghai Stock Exchange - China's largest exchange and one of the most restrictive for foreign investors. \n - Euronext - A pan-European exchange operating markets in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, Oslo, Milan, and Paris. \n - London Stock Exchange (LSE) - One of Europe's oldest exchanges and a financial center. \n - Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) - A critical link between mainland China and international investors. \n - Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) - Canada's largest, particularly strong in natural resources and mining. \n\nThere are many others around the globe. Some exchanges focus on commodities, some on bonds, and some are full-fledged ecosystems. \n\nTypes of Exchanges\n\nExchanges have evolved dramatically over the centuries, but we can broadly categorise modern exchanges into two different types: \n\nFloor-Based Exchanges - The Farmers' Market of Stocks \n\nWhen you think of the stock market with traders running, yelling, and flashing lights as depicted in movies, you are thinking of Floor-Based Exchanges. Floor-based exchanges operate on similar principles as farmers' markets. Picture traders in their colourful jackets, shouting and waving their arms to buy and sell stocks, like farmers bargaining over the price of corn or apples. On a traditional trading floor: \n - Designated market makers (formerly called specialists) are assigned specific stocks, and the parallel in a farmers' market would be each stall owner. \n - Floor brokers execute trades on behalf of clients; on a farmers' market, this would be the customers passing the stalls. \n- Open outcry (hand signals and verbal bids) was traditionally used, which is what you are familiar depicted in movies. \n\nThe image of traders in colourful jackets shouting orders, running from one end to the next and chaos on the floor is historical mainly at this point. Even the NYSE (the most famous example of a floor-based exchange) floor is now primarily a television studio with some minimal trading functions rather than the chaotic scenes depicted in movies. The main reason? It's simply more efficient, accurate, reliable, faster and less chaotic to let computers execute the trades. As volumes rose (amount of trades happening) and technology improved, floor traders became obsolete.\n\nElectronic Exchanges - The Amazon.com of Trading\n\nAs floor-based exchange became obsolete, computers and algorithms took over the main functions. These exchanges are called electronic exchanges. Think of them like an Amazon.com of the exchange world; every action is done faster than you can snap your fingers. Most modern exchanges are fully electronic, including: \n- NASDAQ - Never had a trading floor, pioneering the electronic model \n- Euronext Operates a fully electronic trading platform \n- Most newer exchanges worldwide - Built on electronic models from inception \n\nIn electronic exchanges, computer systems match buyers and sellers automatically. This fact means unlike on floor-based exchanges where trades could take minutes, they occur in milliseconds. Moreover, you don't need to rely on contacting a trader to place an order; you just need a screen! \n\nThis shift to electronic trading has dramatically increased the speed and volume of transactions while reducing costs. The NYSE might execute over 3 billion shares on a typical day, a volume that would have been unimaginable in the era of purely manual trading. That said, I'll tip my hat to the old days. There's something special about the human touch, the energy of a trading floor in full swing and watching the recording of the chaos on the floor it just makes it feel a lot more real. But when you're handling today's markets, you need something that can keep up. It's like choosing between a horse-drawn carriage and a Ferrari. Both will get you there, but one's a lot quicker and doesn't need a barn. \n\nBeyond the Mechanics \n\nWhile the technical operation of exchanges is fascinating, it's important to remember their fundamental economic role. Exchanges provide: \n\n 1. Price discovery - Helping determine what assets are truly worth \n 2. Liquidity - Making it possible to convert investments to cash quickly \n 3. Capital formation - Allowing companies to raise money from the public \n 4. Wealth creation and distribution - Enabling ordinary people to own pieces of successful businesses \n\nWhen you see a stock price flash across your screen, remember that behind that simple number is an intricate system bringing together buyers and sellers from around the world. This system has evolved over centuries, yet it still serves its core purpose: creating a fair, efficient marketplace where capital can flow to its most productive uses. One key feature that distinguishes exchanges from other trading platforms is the central book—and here's why that matters. \n\nWhat Is a Central Book? \n\nThe central book (often called the central limit order book) is a centralized system that records all buy and sell orders for a specific security, like a stock. Picture it as a giant, real- time list, diary, or, more accurately, a ledger: every bid to buy and every offer to sell is logged, and orders are matched based on two simple rules—price and time. The highest bid and lowest ask are collected (see above for definitions) and get priority, and if two orders have the same price, the one placed first goes through. This setup ensures that the exchanges are transparent (everyone sees the same information) and fair (no one jumps the line unfairly). \n\nWhy Does the Central Book Set Exchanges Apart? \n\nUnlike other trading platforms—say, over-the-counter (OTC) (more on this later) markets, where trades can happen privately between parties (parties agree on a price for a transaction)—stock exchanges with a central book offer a single, unified marketplace. Meaning the exact same \"screen\" for everyone. This difference brings some big advantages: \n - Better Liquidity: With all buyers and sellers in one place, it's easier to find a match, reducing drastic price swings. \n - Fairer Prices: Everyone sees the same bids and offers, so there's no room for hidden deals or price discrepancies. \n - More Efficiency: Thanks to the organized system, trades are executed quickly and at the best available prices. \n\nThis centralized approach is a huge reason why stock exchanges have been the backbone of global trading for centuries. They've fine-tuned the art of transforming the chaos of buying and selling into an orderly, reliable process. In our following sections, we'll explore how these exchanges generate revenue, how they're regulated, and why they might make interesting investment opportunities themselves. \n\nTypes of Instruments \n\nNow, I am sure many of you are familiar with the variety of instruments you may encounter in a marketplace, but let's humour me for a moment and try to apply these instruments to a real-life example. \n\nFor the purposes of this explanation, let's say we are taking over an old bookstore called Old Books INC (I know, very original name) from a family friend. We bought their business and got 100% ownership! What did we buy? We purchased a small store that sells stationery items (such as paper, pens, ink, pencils, cards) and books. \n\nNow that we are the proud owner of Old Book INC we have the ambition to build an online retailer to rival Amazon! We have a vision of how we can help develop the business, but we realize we need capital to make that fact a reality. How can we ever raise the necessary capital? \n\n1. Equity \n\nOption 1: Sell a Piece of the Business. \n\nOne way you can raise the necessary capital is to sell a piece of your business. You see this on shows like Shark Tank, where business owners offer a piece of their business for cash; for example, \"we are asking for $100,000 for 25% of the business.\" This process is the selling of equity in your company. Equity comes from the Latin \"aequitas,\" meaning fairness or equality. In finance, it represents a fair claim to ownership. \n\nThere are a few different ways you can sell equity: \n\n - Common Stock: This is the most fundamental form of ownership. If you sold common stock in Old Books INC., buyers would become partial owners with voting rights on major decisions like electing the board of directors. If the bookstore chain becomes profitable, these shareholders might receive dividends – a portion of the profits. If Old Books INC. eventually gets acquired by Barnes & Noble (or Chapters in Canada) for twice its current value, common shareholders would see their investment double. \n - Preferred Stock: Some investors may want more certainty than common stock offers. You could issue preferred stock that promises a fixed 5% annual dividend, paid before any dividends go to common stockholders. These investors might be sacrificing their voting rights. Still, they get first dibs on any profits distributed and, in case of bankruptcy, would be ahead of common shareholders in any sale distributions. \n - Warrants: Some investors may be hesitant to invest in you right now; however, they like your ambition and would like the option to invest in you in the future. They can pay a fee and you would issue warrants that give the investor the right to buy additional shares at today's prices anytime in the next five years. If Old Books INC. turns around and the share price triples, these warrants become very valuable. \n - Rights: If you need a quick capital injection (putting cash into the business) later, you could issue rights to existing shareholders, allowing them to buy additional shares at a 15% discount – rewarding them for their loyalty while raising needed funds. \n\nNotes: Equity instruments are foundational to stock exchanges, traded on platforms like the NYSE or NASDAQ. \n\n2. Bonds (Fixed Income) \nOption 2: \n\nGet a Loan What if you don't want to sell your ownership of Old Book INC? Well, you can always get a loan. You gather your business plans, projections, and bank account information and head to the bank. You sit down with the representative and share your grandiose plans. The representative seems really into it—they give you a big smile, offer you a coffee, and tell you they've got your back. They head upstairs to hash out the final details with their manager. You sit there, proud and happy, your vision inching closer to reality. The representative comes back and says, \"Done deal! We're so excited to help you out—just sign here.\" You read over the terms, and the bank offers you a loan with an interest rate of 25% over 5 years! You're shocked. You can't accept this deal—it's simply too much. If you borrow $100,000, you'd have to pay $225,540 by the end of the loan! Dejected, you leave the bank and start thinking of a new plan. You have a solid reputation in the neighbourhood, along with friends and family, so you decide to get a loan from the public —this is a bond. The term \"bond\" comes from the Old English \"band,\" referring to something that binds or connects—in this case, connecting a borrower to a lender through a financial obligation. \n\nThere are a few different types of bonds: \n\n - Corporate Bonds: Old Books INC. could issue $1 million (in bonds) with a 6% annual interest rate and 10-year maturity. Your rich uncle buys (lends) you $100,000, receiving $6,000 in interest payments annually, with his principal (the $100,000) returned as a lump sum after 10 years. Unlike equity investors, bondholders don't own part of the business – they're lenders with a fixed claim to interest and principal. \n - Convertible Bonds: Maybe nobody wants to lend you at a low interest rate as they think it's too risky. To make your bonds more attractive, you might make them convertible – giving bondholders the option to convert their bonds into a predetermined number of shares (stock) instead of receiving their principal back. If Old Books INC. thrives and its stock soars, bondholders could choose to become owners instead of remaining lenders converting their loan into ownership. \n - Zero-Coupon Bonds: Perhaps you don't want to pay interest yearly because you think you will have more cash later. You might issue zero-coupon bonds that pay no annual interest. Instead, investors buy them at a discount, giving you $600,000 for bonds with a $1 million face value (money returned to the investor once the loan expires), with the difference representing their interest earned. \n\nNotes: While bonds are primarily traded over-the-counter (OTC), some are listed on stock exchanges. Businesses also often hold government bonds issued by governments (e.g., U.S. treasuries, gilts) or municipal bonds, which are issued by local governments and are usually tax-exempt. This is how Warren Buffett holds cash—instead of letting money sit there, you lend it to the government for a short period to earn interest. It's like a very fancy savings account!\n\n 3. Derivatives \n\nYou've secured your capital and are busy building your business! Inside your bookstore, you add a cozy lounge area, serving warm drinks and baked goods to delight your customers. But as time rolls on and your business expands, you notice something tricky: the prices of goods you rely on—books, paper, flour, coffee—keep bouncing up and down throughout the year. It's a headache trying to charge customers consistent prices when your costs won't stay put. You start wondering if there's a way to lock in the prices you pay to wholesalers for books and paper, or even the flour and coffee you need. Heck, you'd even pay extra for that certainty, just to know your costs ahead of time—all you want is stability. Then your friend pipes up with an idea: derivatives. You hesitate, remembering Warren Buffett's stern warning: \"I view derivatives as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system.\" Still, your friend's enthusiasm nudges you to take a closer look. The word \"derivative\" means something drawn from another source—these financial tools get their value from underlying assets. Here are some derivatives you might consider for your business: \n\n- Options: Imagine buying insurance that gives you the option, but doesn't force you, to buy or sell something at “x” price at a later date. That's an option! Say you're worried about a new book by the highly anticipated author's novel flopping, but you don't want to miss out on potential profits if it's the next Harry Potter. You pay the distributor a small fee for the right to buy copies at $10 each in the future without buying any right now. If the book takes off and the price soars, you cash it, securing them at $10 and selling at a profit. If it's a dud, you walk away with no obligation to buy them. Contracts like these give you the right (but not the obligation) to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset at a set price before or at expiration. \n\n- Futures: Similar to options, futures are agreements to buy or sell something at a price locked in today, but here's the catch—you're committed. For example, you want to keep selling coffee at $5 a cup in your lounge, no matter what. So, you buy a futures contract to get coffee beans at $2 per pound in six months. If bean prices drop to $1, you'll pay $2 and miss out on extra profit. But if they shoot up to $4, you're still paying $2, keeping your $5 coffee price steady. It's a trade-off for certainty. \n\n -Forwards: Consider these as futures' private cousins—customized deals not traded on public exchanges. You sit down directly with another business, say a local coffee roaster, and agree to buy beans at $2 per pound next year. It's tailored to your needs, but there's no exchange to back it up—just trust between you and them. Similar to futures, but quieter and more personal. \n\n- Swaps: These are like swapping unpredictability for calm between contracts. Suppose your supplier gives you a rolling credit that is prime (government risk- free rate) + 2%. Another shop in town has a fixed loan at a rate of 5%. You decide you would rather know your expenses than have interest rate risk, so you pay a fee to swap contracts. The other store takes the risk of interest rate jumps, and you get peace of mind (though this is a bit fancy for a small shop and usually happens off-exchange). \n\n- Contracts for Difference (CFDs): These are more like a bet on price moves without owning anything. Say you think flour prices will rise next month. You agree with a broker to pocket the difference between today's $10 per bag and whatever it hits later—maybe $12—without buying the flour. If you're right, you profit; if not, you pay. It's a gamble, not a staple for running your lounge, but it's out there. \n\nNotes: Derivatives can tie to commodities (like your coffee and flour), equities (like books), bonds, currencies, or indices. Some, like futures and options, trade on exchanges; others, like forwards and swaps, happen over-the-counter (OTC). They could steady your costs—or, as Buffett warns, explode if mishandled. 1\n\n 4. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Mutual Funds & Indexes \n\nYou've mastered the financial tricks—loans, bonds, derivatives—and poured that know- how into your bookstore and lounge. Hard work pays off: your business blossoms into a regional champion with multiple locations and one step closer to staring down Amazon. As growth kicks in, you take a big leap and launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO), meaning your shares now trade on an exchange. Congrats! Something neat happens next —those shares start changing hands like hotcakes. People notice, buzz builds, and your business's valuation climbs right along with it. Suddenly, you're on the radar of mutual fund managers, your stock gets roped into indices, and it even lands in ETFs. But what are these things, and why do they matter to you? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, Mutual Funds. These are pools of money from many investors. These pools are later managed by professional money managers and their teams (the teams get paid for their services from the pool). Some of these managers might scoop up your shares. There are two flavours: Open-End Funds, where investors buy or sell shares directly from the fund company—not on exchanges (like ordering straight from the factory) and buy sell on the valuation of what is in the basket. Then there are Closed-End Funds, which trade on exchanges like regular stocks, sometimes at a bargain or a premium to their real value (value of the baskets). If a mutual fund manager likes your bookstore's story—steady coffee sales, loyal book buyers—they might grab your stock for their fund, giving you a cash boost and bragging rights. \n\nNext, Indices. Think of these as scoreboards tracking a bunch of stocks—like the Dow Jones or S&P 500. They don't trade on their own, but they're the backbone for other tools. As your business grows, it might get added to an index, say one for retail or small-cap champs. That's a badge of honour—it means you're a player. Plus, it ties into derivatives (like those index options or futures we talked about) and ETFs (more on this in a second), pulling more eyes your way. \n\nAnd then there's Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Picture a basket of goodies—stocks, bonds, whatever—where you buy one share and get a tiny slice of everything inside instead of buying each piece separately. Your stock might end up in one as you grow. Here's what's out there: Equity ETFs track stock indices, like the S&P 500—maybe your shares join the party. Bond ETFs follow fixed-income stuff, less your speed. Commodity ETFs chase gold or oil prices, though coffee-bean ETFs aren't big yet. Sector ETFs zoom in on industries—imagine a \"bookstore and café\" sector with you in it. And Inverse/Leveraged ETFs? They're wild—betting against or juicing up an index's moves, not your usual cup of coffee. \n\nNotes: ETFs mix stock-like trading (on exchanges) with mutual fund vibes (pooled investments). Mutual funds can be exchange-traded, too, if they're closed-end. Indices? They're the silent engines behind ETFs, futures, and market chatter. Together, they signal your business isn't just a shop anymore—it's a contender. \n\n 5. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) \n\nYou have come a long way. Your bookstore and lounge empire is now a powerhouse, growing steadily and flush with cash. You are itching to grow to rival the big chains around the country. But there are only so many shops you can open before you hit a wall— so you sit down to scout new opportunities. You start studying other successful chains, and one giant catches your eye: Howard Schultz's Starbucks. Digging into their business, you stumble across the \"Starbucks Effect\"—neighbourhood property prices jump when a Starbucks pops up. Curious, you check your own locations. What do you know? Your shops are sparking the same magic. Dollar signs flash in your mind. You could snap up the real estate around your stores and ride that wave—but you don't want to tie up all the precious cash you've earned. So, you hatch a plan: pool some of your money with your investors' and launch a REIT—a Real Estate Investment Trust. Think of a REIT as a stock-like investment that owns a stake in properties or property-related assets. Here's what they look like: \n\n - Equity REITs: These own and run income-producing real estate—think strip malls or buildings near your shops, renting out space for steady cash flow. \n - Mortgage REITs: These focus on lending, investing in mortgages or mortgage- backed securities, earning from interest rather than rent. \n - Hybrid REITs: A mix of both—owning properties and holding mortgages, blending the best of each world. \n\nNotes: REITs trade on exchanges like stocks, letting you dip ig into real estate without locking up all your funds. It's a way to grow your empire beyond books and coffee. \n\nAs your bookstore and lounge empire grows, you might stumble across a few other financial tools—fancy stuff I won’t linger on too long. There’s Commodities, like trading gold, oil, or even coffee beans outright (usually through those futures we talked about) or tracking baskets of them via indices. Then there’s Forex, swapping currencies fast with spot trades, or betting on exchange rates with currency futures and options—handy if your coffee supplier’s overseas. And don’t forget Structured Products: things like asset- backed securities (bonds tied to loans), collateralized debt obligations (fancy loan bundles), or equity-linked notes (debt hitched to stock performance). They’re out there, mostly off-exchange, and might cross your path as you scale up—just don’t trip over them! \n\nBonus - Depository Receipts \n\nHopefully, I haven't lost all of you yet, and you don't feel like all this information is too overbearing. Moreover, I hope you don't fall under the false impression that all these different systems and platforms (that help make today's markets run) are just used to gatekeep it from you and complicate your life. Some of the instruments you can purchase are there to make buying what you are interested in more accessible (of course, a fee is assigned for this convenience). \n\nFor this product, I want you to follow along with a simple thought experiment. For a moment, imagine you are living in a small town in the middle of Canada; you know only English, and your primary source of income is in Canadian dollars. You have become fascinated with buying stock in a South Korean and a Brazilian company. Generally, according to the respective countries' securities laws, you would need to be a resident or have a resident buy stock on your behalf. \n\nYou, living in the middle of Canada, thousands of kilometres away from both Brazil and South Korea, don't know anyone there, can't speak Korean or Portuguese, and have no idea how even to transfer money and convert it to the respective local currencies (Korean won or Brazilian real). How could you possibly buy stock from those countries? Well, like in many things, you can give up and move on... however, you are determined and insist on doing it. Your other option is to hope that the company decides to also list in Canada (being sold in Toronto's stock exchange (TSE) in this case). However, lady luck doesn't shine on you, and that doesn't happen. So you save up, load up Google Translate, pack up your bags, get on a plane, fly, find a broker, try to convert your currency, register with the country, wait, in some cases months, to get approval and then work on reporting income and paying tax on profit in both Canada and South Korea or Brazil... but that's wildly impractical. Is there a better way? Could someone make it easier and help you out? \n\nLet's look back in history to find inspirations for possible solutions. Hundreds of years ago, as commerce was exploding across the continents, merchants could not carry gold or valuables to trade as they were too heavy or impractical. What ended up happening? They would find custodians (such as banks, merchants, governments, etc.) and get a receipt for the gold/valuables. Money was becoming a transaction medium of promise notes (meaning you would get paid a paper certificate or a claim on a trustee's gold reserves); the same idea can be used here for a depository receipt. \n\nThink of depository receipts as incorporating what we discussed about ETFs—a one-stock basket with a hedging tool (a tool used to convert your currency—Canadian dollars—to the local currency of where the stock is from) built in. Let's examine the main types: \n\nADRs --- (American Depository Receipts) \n\nADRs are the most common type of depository receipt, created in 1927 when the American market was looking for ways to invest in foreign companies without the complications of international trading. \n\nHow they work:\n \n 1. A U.S. bank (like JPMorgan Chase or Bank of New York Mellon) purchases shares of a foreign company \n 2. These shares are held in custody at a local branch or correspondent bank in the company's home country \n 3. The U.S. bank issues certificates representing these shares to be traded on American exchanges \n 4. The ADRs are priced in dollars and pay dividends in dollars \n\nReal-life scenario: Say you want to invest in Toyota. Instead of navigating the Tokyo Stock Exchange, you can simply buy Toyota's ADR (ticker: TM) on the New York Stock Exchange. When Toyota pays dividends in yen, the depositary bank converts them to dollars before sending them to ADR holders. One Toyota ADR might represent two actual Toyota shares, depending on how the bank structured the certificate. \n\nADRs come in three levels, each with different requirements: \n - Level I: Traded over-the-counter with minimal SEC reporting requirements \n - Level II: Listed on major exchanges with more disclosure \n - Level III: Allows the company to raise capital in the U.S. market with full SEC registration \n\nCDRs --- (Canadian Depository Receipts) \n\nCDRs are newer than ADRs, launched in 2021 by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). They follow a similar concept but with a key difference in how they handle currency fluctuations. \n\nHow they work: \n \n 1. CIBC purchases shares of a foreign (often U.S.) company \n 2. These shares are held in custody \n 3. CIBC issues certificates representing these shares to be traded on Canadian exchanges \n 4. The CDRs are priced in Canadian dollars and pay dividends in Canadian dollars \n 5. But here is teh kicker Unlike ADRs, CDRs have a floating conversion ratio that changes daily based on exchange rates \n\nReal-life scenario: A Canadian investor interested in Apple doesn't want to deal with currency exchange rates or U.S. estate tax issues. Instead of buying Apple shares directly on the NASDAQ, they can purchase Apple CDRs (ticker: AAPL.NE) on the Neo Exchange in Toronto. \n\nThe floating ratio is what makes CDRs unique. If Apple trades at $175 USD and the exchange rate is 1.35 CAD to 1 USD, CIBC might set the ratio so that one CDR represents 1/10 of an Apple share and trades at around $23.63 CAD ($175 × 1.35 ÷ 10). If the Canadian dollar strengthens against the U.S. dollar the next day, the ratio would automatically adjust to maintain the CDR's price in Canadian dollars. This means CDR holders are protected from currency fluctuations - a significant advantage over ADRs, where the conversion rate is fixed when the ADR is created. \n\nEDRs --- (European Depository Receipts) \n\nEDRs work similarly to ADRs but are for non-European companies looking to access European capital markets. \n\nHow they work: \n - A European bank purchases shares of a non-European company \n - These shares are held in custody \n - The bank issues certificates representing these shares to be traded on European exchanges \n - The EDRs are typically priced in euros \n\nEDRs are less standardized than their American counterparts. While ADRs have been refined over nearly a century with clear SEC guidelines, EDRs operate under various European regulatory frameworks. Some key points about EDRs: \n - They can be traded on multiple European exchanges simultaneously \n - They typically follow a fixed ratio model similar to ADRs rather than the floating ratio of CDRs \n - They're sometimes called Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) when they're designed to be traded on multiple international markets, not just European ones \n - They often have lighter regulatory requirements than ADRs, making them attractive to companies from emerging markets like Russia and India \n\nReal-life scenario: A Russian energy company like Gazprom might issue EDRs traded on the London Stock Exchange. This gives European investors a way to invest in Gazprom through a familiar exchange, with transactions and dividends in euros or pounds rather than rubles. It also allows Gazprom to access European capital without having to meet the full listing requirements of European exchanges. So going back to our Canadian investor wanting to buy South Korean and Brazilian stocks depository receipts provide the solution. Instead of dealing with all those barriers, you can simply buy the ADRs, CDRs, or EDRs (depending on what's available) through your local broker, using your Canadian dollars, filing only Canadian taxes, and sleeping well at night knowing you've diversified globally without all the headaches. \n\n",

        "title": "Timing the market - the psychology of when to buy",
        "selftext": "A common saying amongst investors is 'you can't time the market'. This is often said in relation to timing the market as a whole or an ETF that tracks an index such as the S&P 500. \n\nBut what about individual stocks - can you time those?\n\nPutting aside the idea that a company goes belly up and we lose all our money - let's assume this is a quality company that will likely increase its earnings. **What would be the best way to buy this stock and how could you know at which points to buy?** \n\nWell, firstly you would need to do some level of absolute and relative valuation to determine what you think it's worth - this would likely include some type of discounted cash flow model and a comparison of its peer's financials. \n\nOnce we've done that - we can start looking at multiples. \n\nIndividual stocks normally trade within a multiple range over long periods of time. **What does that mean?** \n\nThe big one you've probably heard of is the price/earnings (or p/e) ratio. The other big one is price/free cash flow. Simply put, it is the number of times you would need to multiply earnings to equal market cap. \n\nIf we look at a chart for [Apple](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio), we can see that Apple's p/e ratio range hovered between 10-35 for the past 14 years. \n\n**What would have been the best way to buy this stock and how could you have known at which points to buy?**\n\nA common trap investors fall into is that they simply want their stock to go up. But if we're buying this stock for 14 years, we don't want a sudden rise. What we actually want is to buy the stock at various points  in line with our income (most of us don't have a $1 million lump sum to chuck into Apple at 10 p/e). **But at what points?** \n\nThis is a a group of words that gets touted a lot and one we all hate by now but - Dollar Cost Average (DCA). Hopefully we all know what this means (if not, please Google). \n\nIf you were to DCA into Apple over those 14 years between the p/e range of 10-35, your average p/e would fall somewhere around 20. (*Like I said, this requires valuation* \\- you cannot guess what p/e range you think a stock will trade based on historical values). \n\nQuite often we're waiting for a stock to be at a bargain of 10 p/e, but during that time we miss the boat and the stock continues to go up - and in hindsight it would have been better to continue buying within our p/e range, even if that meant buying at a 20-30 p/e. \n\nAdditionally, if you look at [charts of Apple's earnings, p/e ratio and stock price ](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)\\- both earnings and stock price have increased markedly since 2010, while p/e ratio has only budged up slightly in comparison. Thus, while multiples can create bargains and volatility in the short term, earnings are the real driver of price over the long term.  \n\nCharlie Munger had a great quote on this, which I will leave you with: \n\n*‘Over the long term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you’re not going to make much different than a 6% return – even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you’ll end up with a fine result.’*",

        "title": "Thoughts on the impact of the Magnificent 7 on the returns of the S&P 500",
        "selftext": "The S&P 500 has offered exceptional returns since the beginning of 2023. It rallied 26% in 2023, 23% in 2024, and it is already up 2.5% this year. While this performance is impressive, the effect of the Magnificent 7 on the returns of the S&P 500 has dramatically increased in recent years. As a result, it is important for investors to know the quantitative effect of the Magnificent 7 on the benchmark index and have a sense of what to expect this year.\n\nFirst of all, the weight of the Magnificent 7, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), on the S&P 500 has surged from 22% in 2020 to 33% now. This is the highest percent of the seven largest companies in history. In other words, never in history have the seven largest companies comprised one-third of the S&P 500.\n\nNotably, the outsized returns of the S&P 500 in each of the last two years resulted almost fully from the Magnificent 7. Without these stocks, the S&P 500 would have returned just 4.1% in 2023 and 6.3% in 2024. It is thus important to realize the impact of each of these juggernauts on the total return of the stock market.\n\nSome investors claim that the broad stock market has performed poorly, as its return would have been modest without the contribution from the seven largest stocks. However, it is misleading to exclude the best stocks and draw conclusions about the broad market. This bias is essentially the same as the well-known “cherry picking” bias, which can lead to highly misleading conclusions.\n\nOn the other hand, it is important to realize that just seven companies affect the total return of the stock market to a great extent. As these companies essentially belong to the same sector (even Tesla is essentially a tech stock given its innovation; it is not a conventional consumer discretionary stock), the S&P 500 is much less diversified than most investors think. If the tech sector faces a downturn, such as deceleration in the artificial intelligence boom or competition from foreign competitors, it is likely to severely hurt the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nOn the one hand, the Magnificent 7 are not likely to match this year the returns they offered in recent years due to their rich valuation levels. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla are currently trading at forward P/E ratios of 29.2, 31.1, 31.0, 36.4, 20.8, 28.3 and 124, respectively. On the other hand, as long as these exemplary companies maintain their exciting growth prospects, their stocks are likely to maintain their premium valuation. These seven stocks are expected by analysts to grow their earnings per share by 50%, 12%, 9%, 14%, 12%, 6% and 20%, respectively, this year.\n\nAs a group, the Magnificent 7 are currently trading at a weighted average forward P/E ratio of 36.2 and they are expected to grow their earnings per share by a weighted average of 19% this year. Given their impressive record of beating the analysts’ estimates, the Magnificent 7 are highly likely to meet or exceed the analysts’ estimates this year. If they do and they maintain their exciting growth potential, their stocks are likely to maintain their premium valuation. If their average P/E ratio remains approximately flat, the Magnificent 7 are likely to rally 19% this year (their return will be roughly equal to their EPS growth rate).\n\nOf course, it is impossible to predict the future valuation of these stocks but the above provides an indication of what return to expect this year if the companies meet the analysts’ consensus and their growth potential remains strong. If the Magnificent 7 rally 19% this year, they will contribute a 6.3% return to the S&P 500 (=19% times 33%).\n\nThis is a great boost to the S&P 500 by just seven stocks but it is nowhere close to the boost received in each of the last two years (22% in 2023 and 17% in 2024). If the P/E ratios of the Magnificent 7 expand, their contribution to the S&P 500 will be even higher, but it is prudent not to rely on such an outcome, given the already high P/E ratios of these stocks.\n\nTo conclude, the S&P 500 is less diversified than ever due to the huge weight of the seven greatest technological stocks in the index. As a result, most of the excessive returns of the index since the beginning of 2023 have resulted from the Magnificent 7. On the one hand, investors should be aware of the high sensitivity of the S&P 500 to the performance of just a few stocks, particularly given the rich valuation of these stocks. On the other hand, given the absence of any signs of fatigue on the business prospects of the Magnificent 7, the outlook remains positive for the S&P 500.\n\nIf you found this article interesting, you are likely to find this investing book interesting as well:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Investing-Stocks-Bonds-Retirement-Project/dp/B0D47BPY9J/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?crid=1PQOVON5V3P4V&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TqRtNB85UCHComFFpkLeAqEoSvDZHSbFEgRm74g10c3GjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.RnSJ8Q5UP-ooXdONWUiL7D3UH\\_06GolyxNQjD3xSxI8&dib\\_tag=se&keywords=aristofanis+papadatos&qid=1739194231&s=books&sprefix=aristofanis+papadatos%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C468&sr=1-1](https://www.amazon.com/Investing-Stocks-Bonds-Retirement-Project/dp/B0D47BPY9J/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1PQOVON5V3P4V&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TqRtNB85UCHComFFpkLeAqEoSvDZHSbFEgRm74g10c3GjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.RnSJ8Q5UP-ooXdONWUiL7D3UH_06GolyxNQjD3xSxI8&dib_tag=se&keywords=aristofanis+papadatos&qid=1739194231&s=books&sprefix=aristofanis+papadatos%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C468&sr=1-1)",

        "title": "Investing in Stocks with Strong Free Cash Flow: A Key Strategy for Success",
        "selftext": "Free cash flow is a vital financial metric that provides insights into a company’s financial health and operational efficiency. It is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. Companies with positive free cash flow have the flexibility to reinvest in their business, return capital to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks, pursue growth opportunities, and navigate challenging economic conditions.\n\nWhy Focus on Stocks with Strong Free Cash Flow?\n\nInvestors are drawn to companies with strong free cash flow for several reasons:\n\nFinancial Stability: Companies with consistent positive free cash flow are better positioned to weather economic downturns and unforeseen challenges. They have the resources to meet debt obligations, invest in research and development, and innovate to stay competitive in the market.\n\nCapital Allocation: Companies with excess free cash flow can strategically allocate capital to value-creating initiatives such as acquisitions, expansions, or returning cash to shareholders. This disciplined approach to capital allocation enhances shareholder value over the long term.\n\nGrowth Potential: Strong free cash flow allows companies to invest in growth opportunities, drive product development, and expand market share. As a result, investors may benefit from capital appreciation as the company’s value increases.\n\nReturn on Investment: Investing in companies with solid free cash flow yields can potentially lead to attractive returns for investors. Companies that consistently generate excess cash may reward shareholders through dividends, stock buybacks, or reinvestment in the business for sustainable growth.\nIdentifying Stocks with Strong Free Cash Flow\n\nWhen evaluating potential investment opportunities, investors can analyze a company’s free cash flow and key metrics to gauge its financial health and future prospects. Some aspects to consider include:\n\nFree Cash Flow Yield: Calculated by dividing free cash flow by market capitalization, the free cash flow yield provides insights into how efficiently a company generates cash relative to its valuation. A higher free cash flow yield indicates a stronger company.\n\nOperating Performance: Analyzing a company’s free cash flow growth trend, cash flow from operations, and cash conversion cycle can provide a comprehensive overview of its operational performance and financial strength.\n\nDividend Payout Ratio: Assessing the percentage of free cash flow allocated towards dividends helps determine whether a company’s dividend payments are sustainable and if there is room for future dividend increases.\n\nSeveral companies demonstrate a consistent track record of generating strong free cash flow and prudent capital management:\n\nApple (AAPL): A technology giant known for its strong free cash flow generation, Apple has a history of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nMicrosoft (MSFT): With a focus on innovation and diversification, Microsoft has consistently produced robust free cash flow, allowing it to invest in growth initiatives and reward shareholders.\n\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ): A healthcare stalwart, Johnson & Johnson’s stable cash flows and prudent financial management have positioned it as a reliable dividend payer and a defensive investment choice.\n\nIn conclusion, investing in stocks with strong free cash flow is a fundamental strategy for long-term success in the stock market. By focusing on companies with robust cash generation, prudent capital allocation, and sustainable growth prospects, investors can enhance their portfolios’ resilience and potential for attractive returns. Conducting thorough research, monitoring key financial metrics, and staying informed about market trends are essential practices for identifying and capitalizing on investment opportunities in companies with strong free cash flow.",

        "title": "Is this the Beginning of the End for Apple Stock?",
        "selftext": "I spent the last few weeks diving deep into Apple and walked away with more questions than answers. Everyone knows Apple is one of the highest-quality companies in the world. The brand strength is second to none, the cash flows are pristine, and the capital return program is immaculate. But the valuation just doesn’t make sense to me anymore. At over $3 trillion and a P/E of 31, I’m struggling to justify why I’d want to be long at these levels.\n\nI broke the company down across six core dimensions: valuation, product innovation, services, competitive positioning, capital allocation, and strategic vision. What stood out most was the lack of future investment and positioning. Apple is still refining its ecosystem, but it no longer feels like it’s expanding it. It’s been nearly a decade since a true breakout product. Vision Pro is impressive on a hardware level, but it hasn’t found real traction and is completely too expensive for mass market adoption. The iPhone remains dominant, but dependency on a single product this far in feels fragile.\n\nServices are a bright spot in terms of margin contribution, but even there, I see structural risks. The Google Search deal alone makes up a huge share of services revenue and could be threatened by regulatory changes. Meanwhile, platform control over things like the App Store is under pressure in Europe and increasingly in the U.S. There’s also a saturation problem. Apple has over 2 billion active devices. Future growth comes mostly from squeezing more out of existing users, not expanding the base. Something I personally have grown tired of as an Iphone user.\n\nFrom a competitive standpoint, Apple feels like it's falling behind. Microsoft owns the AI stack from chip to cloud to productivity. Google is pushing vertically with Gemini and TPUs (not to mention Waymo, Quantum, etc). Meta is all-in on open source and model training. Apple, in contrast, is integrating other people's models while staying out of infrastructure entirely. That may be fine in the short term, but over time, it limits value capture. If you don’t own the tech, you’re stuck renting it at best.\n\nOn capital allocation, Apple has been masterful. The buyback has driven EPS growth far beyond what revenue growth would suggest. But buybacks only create durable value when the stock is undervalued. At 31x earnings, that’s a tough argument to make. Dividends are modest and consistent, but nothing to base a long-term position on.\n\nWhat really sealed my concern was modeling out different return scenarios. I included dividend yield in every case. In the bull case, assuming 8% EPS CAGR and a 30x multiple, I end up with around a 7.5% total return per year. Not bad, but hardly compelling when compared to alternatives. In the base case, where EPS grows 5% and the P/E compresses to 25, returns fall to around 1.6% annually. And in the re-rating case, EPS growth at 2% and a 15x multiple, total return becomes deeply negative. A 50% drawdown is not unthinkable if the narrative ever shifts from “tech growth compounder” to “incredible consumer staple with high market share.”\n\nTo be clear, I’m not calling for Apple to collapse. The business and brand are rock solid. But the stock is priced for a future I’m not sure is coming. It reminds me of Coca-Cola in the late 1990s. A world-class brand, dominant in its category, but trading at growth multiples long after the real growth had slowed. Those who held from 1998 waited over a decade just to break even in real terms.\n\nI don’t think Apple is a short. But I can’t make a strong case for going long from here either. The risk-reward is skewed. Upside is limited even if things go well. Downside becomes real if the market ever reprices the stock based on forward returns instead of past excellence.\n\nI do think that Apple will remain inflated due to its easy inclusion in so many different funds, but this too can't hold up the PE forever. IMO Apple does not deserve an equal or higher PE than MSFT, GOOG, META, and AMZN and it's not particularly close. ",

        "selftext": "I'm a beginner to investing btw, so I'm sorry for any mistakes.\n\nAnd I mean buying the stock of the phone company, not the vegetable. Because that would be a depreciating asset. Because like if I bought an apple, I'll just take a bite because I like apples and now it's that much less valuable. And I wouldn't be able to stop because apples taste pretty nice.\n\nI think it's good time for me to buy because the price is back down to good levels. Also their conference thing is coming up next month. And pretty cool people work there so they will announce some cool features and stuff I assume.\n\nAnd like they are going to launch higher priced phones, but the design is totally different. And as much as people may hate it, they will buy it, because it's a new design. Plus their decision to make all cameras 48 MP will be something every reviewer will talk about.\n\nAlso they are exempt from tariffs anyway and like their apple intelligence has been pretty bad so far, but I'm sure this time they will fix it so it will be pretty cool too. Plus the new air model and stuff will make it so more people buy different models, like apple has always been good at making people buy the more pricey items in their lineup.\n\nSo I personally think a lot of value to come from the company and this looks like a cool price to buy at and maybe sell in 3-4 months.\n\nIt went pretty low to 170ish when tariffs were first invented, then it was also like 250ish max in the previous year. So like 200 sounds pretty cool to buy considering what's coming up.\n\nBut also I saw on reddit someone said treasury something something is 5% and that means there will be less spending power so idk and with apple raising prices for the coming lineup idk. So like maybe I shouldn't, but maybe I should? I think I'm going to, it just feels right?\n\nThanks. This isn't financial advice btw, just my opinions and feels.",

        "title": "Tariff Impact on Apple Valuation",
        "selftext": "This is very rough back of the envelope math, but trying to see if the market moves last week changed how it’s valuing apple.\n\nLet’s say the China tariff expectation before liberation day announcement was 10% (idk, is that fair?) and actual is 60% (this is really rough math.)\n\n$100b annual net income, 65% of apples revenue comes from made in China products (is that fair?)\n\nApple can pass 60% of tariff costs to consumers, eats 40%\n\nSo, with 10% tariffs, tariffs affect 65% of 100b net income, 10% of 65 =6.5, Apple takes 40% hit so 3B hit to net income.\n\n60% tariffs is 65b * .6 = 39 * 16b hit to net income.\n\nI’m not even going to try to model out the 3b. Kind of negligible imo. But now let’s say, again extremely roughly, apples net income falls 16b due to the tariffs, so 16% down to their valuation because their net income is 100b. I know this is tough. Poke holes in it if you want.\n\nStock is down like 13% in last week. So is market valuing Apple about the same? Disagree? Am I wrong?

        "selftext": "Apple is the world’s most valuable company, the most beloved consumer brand, and the best-run capital return machine in the modern stock market. It has survived every bear thesis, adapted to every challenge, and delivered shareholders a relentless stream of buybacks, dividends, and steady earnings growth.\n\nAt 33x forward earnings, the market is pricing Apple as if it will continue this dominance indefinitely. But no company can defy gravity forever. Apple’s next phase of growth depends on emerging markets, where its traditional advantages—brand strength, pricing power, and ecosystem lock-in—are not guaranteed to work the same way they have in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMuch like a perfectly applied face of makeup, Apple looks flawless at first glance. But take a closer look, and a few cracks start to appear. Buybacks are masking slowing earnings growth. Services margins, long assumed to be unassailable, are under regulatory threat. And in markets where Apple is banking on its next wave of users, it’s facing competition from companies that know these regions better and are playing an entirely different game.\n\nThe market assumes Apple will extend its dominance effortlessly. The data suggests otherwise.\n\n# The Market Assumes the iPhone Will Conquer Everywhere. That’s a Risky Bet.\n\nIn North America, Apple’s pricing power is sacred. In emerging markets, it is anything but.\n\nApple’s dominance in the U.S. is built on two things: a premium brand and a seamless ecosystem. People don’t leave iOS because switching out of iMessage, AirDrop, and the App Store is a hassle. But in places like India, Latin America, and Africa, the default phone isn’t an iPhone. It’s an Android device, often made by Xiaomi, OPPO, or Transsion, where users have already built their own ecosystems of digital services.\n\nThat’s a problem for Apple’s long-term growth. If users in these markets don’t start on iOS, they aren’t going to be locked into Apple’s ecosystem later. And in the places where Apple is growing, it’s often doing so by selling older iPhones at discounted prices—an approach that works for market share but erodes the premium pricing model that has sustained its margins.\n\nApple is winning some battles, but at what cost?\n\n* **Latin America**: iPhone shipments jumped 21% year-over-year in 2024, but most of that growth came from discounted older models and local assembly in Brazil to avoid import tariffs. The broader smartphone market in the region grew 10% in the same period. That means Apple isn’t necessarily taking over—it’s just keeping up by cutting prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi continues to outsell Apple, offering comparable hardware at a fraction of the price.\n* **India**: Apple is making its biggest push yet, opening flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi, ramping up local manufacturing, and introducing aggressive financing options. Morgan Stanley estimates India will account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth over the next five years. But the market reality is stark: iOS has less than 11% market share, and the vast majority of smartphones sold in India cost under $300. Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.\n* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.\n* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.\n\nThe big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.\n\n# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.\n\nApple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.\n\nBut Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.\n\n* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.\n* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.\n* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.\n\nThe App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.\n\nInvestors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.\n\n# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.\n\nApple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.\n\n* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.\n* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.\n* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.\n\n# When Does Apple Become a Buy?\n\nApple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:\n\n* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.\n* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.\n* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.\n\nApple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price?

        "selftext": "I've been thinking about a way to intuitively understand value investing and IMO overlaying market cap and earnings is one of the best ways to do so. The market price is always right by definition but that doesn't necessary mean that the mark-to-market market cap makes sense.\n\nCompanies are primarily money making machines and by analyzing how effectively they make money you can anchor your evaluation of the price.\n\nE.g in this image: [https://imgur.com/a/bQD98jc](https://imgur.com/a/bQD98jc) You can see that the market cap is mostly correlated with earnings over the last decade (Buffett bought in around 2016). P/E expanded heavily post COVID liquidity and even today is at 40x.\n\n(The multiplier is set at 18x b/c that is where the support was during the COVID liquidity crisis matched by repeated support around Feb 2023)\n\nPrices can remain elevated as long as the next marginal buyer believes in the price support. **Value investing is just being very conservative with the price support** and basing it on real data like historical earnings and analyst predicted earnings vs say drawing lines on a chart.\n\nThe gap between how elevated the market cap line is over the earnings (using whatever p/e multiplier you believe makes sense) is a measure of how \"optimistic\" the active market participants are. In AAPLs case, the analysts maybe believe in lowered growth % wise due to global market saturation (VR headsets don't have a market large enough)\n\nThis is a free tool I built and you can play around with it at:  [www.theory-a.com/analyze/AAPL](http://www.theory-a.com/analyze/AAPL)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

        "title": "Apple Stock: My thoughts on price, revenue segments and devices",
        "selftext": "Apple surprised the market by reporting record-high financial results for Q4 2024 (ending September 28, 2024), with revenue hitting $94.9 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year. This performance defied expectations, fueled by the launch of the iPhone 16 lineup, packed with innovative features and the introduction of Apple Intelligence.\n\nMany investors were caught off guard, as sentiment around Apple had turned cautious. Concerns about the company’s growth potential were mounting, especially amid global political challenges. Governments worldwide have been ramping up efforts to tax foreign products, while China has been tightening restrictions on Apple’s market presence, citing privacy and AI content moderation concerns.\n\nBefore we explore these challenges in detail, let’s first take a closer look at Apple’s net sales by reported segments over the past three years.\n\nLooking at Apple’s net sales in Greater China, it’s clear that the company faces significant challenges. While sales in major quarters like Q1 have dropped noticeably, other quarters, including Q4, have shown more stability with only slight declines over time. This reflects Apple’s strategic decision not to push back against China’s stringent regulations. With China accounting for one-fifth of Apple’s sales and producing a large share of its devices (though some production has shifted to India and the U.S.), resistance would be costly.\n\nHowever, Beijing isn’t making things easy. Every time CEO Tim Cook steps back to comply with regulatory demands, the Chinese government seems to expect even more concessions. The big question remains: How long will Apple choose accommodation, and how long will Chinese consumers continue choosing Apple over domestic rivals like Huawei?\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s relationship with Europe tells a different story. Despite increasingly strict EU regulations, Apple has steadily expanded its market presence there. Interestingly, the company has taken a unique approach by delaying some software features in Europe, attributing the delays to regulatory challenges. This seems like a calculated move to shift consumer pressure onto EU regulators.\n\nApple’s strategy in these two key regions highlights the delicate balance between compliance, competition, and customer loyalty. It’s a game worth watching closely.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at Apple’s sales by product category. As many investors have already realized, it’s hard to imagine Apple launching another groundbreaking product on the scale of the iPhone. It’s not for lack of trying, but consumer adoption of Apple’s (other tech giants have the same problem) newer products hasn’t yet reached the same iconic status.\n\nThat said, Apple’s future looks promising with its lineup of “affordable luxury” products like wearables, the MacBook Air, and the Mac mini. These devices have been well-received and are likely to continue driving revenue growth.\n\nWe can also see Apple gradually shifting its business core from hardware like the iPhone to services. This appears to be Tim Cook’s long-term strategy: making Apple Services the key reason customers stay loyal to the brand. The seamless integration of devices and services—where a new Apple device instantly feels like “your own” through automatic syncing—is a powerful incentive for consumers. It turns the high price tag into a convenience many are willing to pay for.\n\n**Apple’s ecosystem** might just be its **most valuable product of all**.\n\n# Where Does Apple’s Stock Price Stand Today?\n\nThe big question on every investor’s mind: where does Apple’s stock price sit right now? At the time of writing, Apple is trading near its all-time high of $242 per share, which, in my view, seems a bit overvalued. However, many investors are already placing their bets on Apple’s upcoming Q1 2025 revenue.\n\nHistorically, Q1 has been Apple’s strongest quarter, and Wall Street is optimistic that the next one could be the company’s best yet. With a refreshed product lineup and Apple’s new AI features exclusive to its latest devices, it’s not hard to see why expectations are so high.\n\nAs a long-term value investor, I believe the current price is stretched, and I prefer to wait for a better entry point. Apple’s stock has historically provided attractive dips, offering patient investors great buying opportunities. Let’s not forget that its 52-week low was around $160, and in January 2023, shares were even available for as low as $120.",

We've had over a decade of the fed injecting unprecedented amount of liquidity into the financial system - its not a coincidence that we've seen the biggest bull run in our lifetimes beginning after the 2008 financial crisis, because that's precisely when this started happening with QE. Then this got turbocharged again during the 2020 pandemic. Look at this graph of M2 money supply: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) \\- **investable money has nearly 3x since the start of QE**. All that money has to go somewhere, which is why we see the current \"everything\" bubble with stocks and RE all at all time highs. \n\n2.

The [top 10% of earners own 93% of the stock market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wealthiest-10-americans-own-93-033623827.html), these folks don't need the money they invest to fund their day to day lives and are just looking for the best return on their money. \n\nThis is basic supply and demand problem --> there's been a huge increase in demand for investments with the increased money supply (M2 graph shown above) but the supply of investment opportunities have not kept pace and could argue even decreased: \n\n\\- limited increase in housing supply even as total populations grow and economic opportunities get increasingly  concentrated in a small number of metro areas\n\n\\- a digital economy that makes it easier than ever for huge companies to dominate and further entrench their dominance by unlocking economies of scale, leading to fewer total winners - why invest in 5 different specialty retailers when amazon sells everything for cheaper and delivers to you faster?\n\n  \nThe market may very well be overvalued - who knows - but coming to that judgement purely by looking at historical norms is comparing apples to oranges. The fact is that a smaller number of people hold the vast majority of the investable wealth in the US and all that money is looking to make a return somewhere - so with real estate also at all time highs and in many ways even more overvalued than the stock market when comparing the cost to buy vs rent, combined with interest rates coming down, *where else is all that money going to go?*\n\n  \n",

But despite that iconic status, the company is facing one of the most challenging stretches in its modern history.\n\nSales are slowing, margins are under pressure, and tariffs threaten the entire supply chain. Add to that a shaky DTC strategy, strained wholesale relationships, and a stretch of underwhelming innovation, and you’ve got a company in the middle of a full-blown reset.\n\n**From the Track to the Racks**\n\nNike’s story starts on a track in Oregon. In the 1960s, University track coach Bill Bowerman teamed up with his former student Phil Knight to sell high-quality Japanese running shoes in the U.S. under the name Blue Ribbon Sports.\n\nTheir inspiration? Japanese cameras. At the time, brands like Canon and Nikon were taking market share from dominant German makers. Bowerman and Knight believed the same disruption could happen in footwear, where Adidas and Puma ruled the track.\n\nSo they partnered with Japanese shoe manufacturer Onitsuka Tiger, and the business took off. Sales grew, momentum built — until they found out Onitsuka was quietly shopping for new U.S. distributors behind their back.\n\nFeeling betrayed, Bowerman and Knight made a bold decision: go solo. No more reselling — they’d make their own shoes.\n\nAnd just like that, Nike was born. One of the most iconic brands in the world was created in a matter of days. The name “Nike” came from the Greek goddess of victory. The Swoosh? Designed by a college student for $35.\n\nBut don’t worry — a few years later, Knight gave her 500 shares of Nike. If she held on, that little logo turned her into a millionaire.\n\nNike’s early strategy was simple but effective: selling shoes straight out of car trunks at track meets, building personal relationships with runners, and even creating one of the first informal customer databases — tracking shoe sizes, race schedules, and athlete preferences to stay connected. It worked. The first 50,000 pairs were sold almost entirely through word of mouth.\n\nOne of the most iconic early models was the Moon Shoe — designed by Bowerman and inspired by his attempt to improve traction using a waffle iron from his kitchen.\n\nPerhaps the first signal of just how far Bowerman and Knight were willing to go to build the best running shoes in the world — and the Moon Shoe became their first true breakthrough.\n\nFrom there, Nike’s innovation streak took off: the Waffle Trainer, Air cushioning in the Tailwind, and later the futuristic Nike Shox, made famous by Vince Carter’s Olympic dunk over a 7'2\" Frenchman in 2000.\n\n\n\n**The Best Deal in Sports History**\n\nWhile Nike’s early models laid the foundation for its reputation in performance and innovation, what truly catapulted the company into global dominance was arguably the greatest marketing move in sports history.\n\nIn October 1984, Nike signed a young, promising rookie named Michael Jordan. It wasn’t an easy deal — Jordan had his heart set on Adidas, but they weren’t focused on basketball then. Nike saw the opportunity and took a bold swing.\n\nThey offered him a five-year, $2.5 million contract, which, at the time, was basically their entire marketing budget, and built an entire brand around him. The goal was to sell $1 million worth of Air Jordans in the first year.\n\nInstead, they sold $126 million.\n\nThat single bet didn’t just change Nike’s trajectory — it redefined how athletes, brands, and marketing would work for decades to come.\n\n\n\n**The Landscape is Changing**\n\nFor a long time, there were two dominant players in the global footwear and apparel industry: Nike and Adidas. And yes — both still lead the pack. But the momentum has shifted, and lately, it hasn’t been in Nike’s favor.\n\nIn the U.S. market, Adidas has grown its share from 6% to 11% over the last decade, while Nike’s share has stagnated. At the same time, a new trend has emerged: smaller, performance-focused brands are entering the market and gaining serious traction. Two of the most talked-about in recent years are the Swiss brand On and the French brand Hoka.\n\nBefore we dig into the impact these rising players have had — and Nike’s loss of global market share — it’s worth asking: How did we get here?\n\nLike most major shifts, it’s not monocausal. A handful of factors played a role. But in Nike’s case, there’s a particularly clear catalyst: the company’s DTC pivot under former CEO John Donahoe — a strategy that, in hindsight, didn’t play out the way investors had hoped.\n\nNike originally built its dominance through wholesale. For years, it was the undisputed leader in almost every major shoe retailer. But if you look at the 2024 numbers, Nike’s wholesale-to-DTC ratio is now only slightly tilted in favor of wholesale — a big shift from how the business used to operate.\n\nThat change began in 2017, when Nike made a strategic pivot toward direct-to-consumer. Under then-CEO Mark Parker, Nike’s digital business took off. In 2014, online sales totaled just over $1 billion. Five years later, that number had grown fivefold.\n\nThe direction seemed clear: Nike would leverage its brand power by focusing more on DTC, especially through digital channels.\n\nAnd then came what looked like a perfect fit. Just a few years earlier, John Donahoe had joined Nike’s board. With experience as CEO of eBay and ServiceNow, and as Chairman of the Board at PayPal, he brought deep digital expertise. So when Parker stepped down, Donahoe — the tech operator — was tapped to lead Nike into its next phase: a digital-first future.\n\nBefore Donahoe, Nike had only three CEOs. First, the founder, Phil Knight. Then William Perez, Nike’s first external hire, and finally, Mark Parker, who came up through the company and led for over 13 years. Perez, on the other hand, lasted just two. He left after being deemed “not a good cultural fit.”\n\nAt Nike, culture matters. It’s a fuzzy term — one that’s often used as corporate filler. I’m the first to roll my eyes when someone brings up “culture” in a boardroom pitch. But there’s a difference between talking about culture and living it — and Nike has always lived it. You see it in the stories, the athlete relationships, and the leadership style. More on that later when we talk about Elliott Hill, Nike’s new CEO.\n\n*(Just a quick note, I share stock breakdowns like this weekly, with charts and downloadable valuation models, in free emails — subscribe* [*here*](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/newsletters/?utm_source=Reddit) *if that interests you.)*\n\nThe problem Nike had with Perez came back with Donahoe. Despite years on the board, he never quite embodied the Nike way. He led like a consultant, which isn’t all that surprising given his background. Before eBay and ServiceNow, Donahoe spent 20 years at Bain & Company, one of the most prestigious consulting firms in the world, eventually becoming CEO and President.\n\nStill, despite the cultural mismatch, Donahoe’s first year as CEO looked like a success. Nike quickly doubled online revenue, surpassing $10 billion in digital sales. The pandemic certainly helped — stores were closed, and running became a go-to hobby when it was one of the few things people could still do outdoors.\n\nIt was around this time that Donahoe said what’s now become an almost iconic quote: “The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back.”\n\nWell… the consumer did revert back.\n\nPeople were eager to get out again and experience shopping in person. And honestly, I get it. Call me old-school, but I’ve never really understood how people buy shoes online. I need to try them on, walk a few steps. If I ordered without trying them, I’d be sending 90% of them back.\n\nBut let’s get back to Nike’s problem. A major part of the DTC strategy was cutting ties with wholesalers — including Foot Locker, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and many others. The idea was to drive more traffic through Nike’s own channels. But that came at a cost.\n\nJust Foot Locker and Dick’s alone have around five times as many stores as Nike does across the U.S. Cutting those partnerships meant walking away from shelf space — and from millions of eyeballs, free marketing, and the impulse purchases that come with it.\n\nNaturally, a lot of shoppers didn’t head straight to Nike stores — they went to wholesalers. Many of them probably still wanted to buy Nike shoes. And historically, they could. Nike was the No. 1 brand in almost every major retailer. In 2020, 75% of Foot Locker’s inventory comprised Nike and Jordan products.\n\nThat changed quickly.\n\nAfter Nike decided to scale back wholesale partnerships, Foot Locker’s Nike allocation dropped by more than 20%. Other retailers saw even steeper declines. The move hurt both sides — retailers lost a key traffic driver, and the abrupt decision caused many to lose trust in Nike.\n\nAnd when Nike realized it had overestimated its brand pull, it was already in a tough spot. Consumers weren’t walking out of Foot Locker empty-handed and heading to the nearest Nike store — they were just buying something else. The shelves were filled with other brands, and to the retailers’ surprise, those brands sold just fine.\n\nSo when Nike tried to return, it no longer had the same leverage. Retailers didn’t feel the urgency to bring Nike back at the same volume — or on the same terms.\n\nAnd that opened the door for a new wave of brands like On and Hoka. Both were founded by athletes, both offered innovative technology, and both captured consumer excitement, especially among runners and performance-focused shoppers.\n\nWhich leads us to Nike’s second big mistake during its DTC push: It neglected the product.\n\n\n\n**The Decline of Nike Shoes**\n\nI’ve mentioned how Nike used to be an innovation machine. In its early days, product came first — and Nike made sure that mindset stayed at the core of the company. That’s what culture meant at Nike: being product-obsessed, hungry to win, and always pushing new ideas forward.\n\nBut in recent years, Nike has lost that edge. There haven’t been many groundbreaking innovations. Sure, there have been announcements — but not much to back them up.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nAs the company focused on building out its online presence, the product took a back seat. Resources were reallocated, and the goal quietly shifted — from making the best shoes to making more shoes, in order to drive DTC volume and hit digital growth targets.\n\nThat’s why we got wave after wave of Air Max and Air Jordan re-releases in every colorway imaginable — instead of truly new technology. And to be clear: I like those shoes. A lot of people do. But when you flood the market with them, they start to lose their appeal.\n\nFor years, Nike struck the perfect balance — selling at scale while still keeping sneakerheads engaged through scarcity, excitement, and originality. But as the product strategy leaned too far into mass availability, that balance began to slip—and with it, demand.\n\nUnder Donahoe, the balance tipped further toward the volume game, while Nike drifted away from speaking to sneaker culture — the very community that helped build its brand. And look, it would be easy to pin all of this on Donahoe. But that wouldn’t be fair — or true.\n\nNike’s size alone makes it incredibly hard to tailor products to every consumer. Smaller brands like On and Hoka are naturally more agile and can move faster in terms of both design and messaging.\n\nBut here’s the thing: Nike has always had that disadvantage. Long before Donahoe ever became CEO. Something else changed.\n\nWhat changed was how Nike approached its customers.\n\nHistorically, Nike thrived in what’s called a pull market — where you first create a product, and then create demand for it. And Nike mastered this model for two key reasons:\n\nFirst, it was relentlessly product-focused. The innovation was there. The designs were there. Nike shoes didn’t just look good — they performed. In 2019, Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge became the first human to run a marathon distance in under two hours. The controversy? His Nike Vaporfly shoe. Designed so well, it was rumored to have a material impact on the runner’s time. World Athletics even banned the shoe from subsequent races.\n\nSecond, Nike had — and still has — the most powerful athlete portfolio in the world. From Michael Jordan to Serena Williams, LeBron James to Cristiano Ronaldo — no brand has paired product with star power as effectively as Nike.\n\nI know firsthand how powerful Nike’s pull factor used to be. As a kid, I didn’t just want football shoes — I wanted the exact pair my favorite player wore. Nothing else mattered. The same goes for kids who idolize basketball players, tennis stars, golfers, or even celebrities. Nike made it easy to create demand because when you combined that emotional connection with a high-quality product, Nike was unbeatable.\n\nBut in recent years, that model started to break down. As Nike shifted away from its product-first mindset, it also moved away from operating in a pull market. Instead, it started behaving like a typical push brand — trying to predict what consumers wanted and then building products to match.\n\nThat approach doesn’t work for Nike.\n\nThey’re too big, too slow, and frankly, too far removed from niche consumer trends to play that game well. And more importantly, they’ve historically had an edge most brands could only dream of: the ability to shape taste, not follow it.\n\nBut once Nike realized it couldn’t reliably guess what consumers wanted, it made a familiar move — it doubled down on its legacy models. As I mentioned earlier, that’s how we ended up with a flood of Jordans and Air Maxes in every color combination imaginable.\n\n\n\n**Reviving Nike — Win Now!**\n\nLast October, a new chapter began at Nike. Elliott Hill returned to the company — this time as CEO — after working his way up through Nike’s ranks from 1988 to 2020. He started as an intern. When he left, he was the President of Consumer and Marketplace.\n\nHill understands and embodies Nike like few others. For perspective, when he joined in 1988, Nike’s market cap was around $700 million. Today, Nike generates that much in revenue every five days.\n\nSince returning, Hill has wasted no time. He launched what he calls the Win Now strategy — a plan to get Nike back on track by doing what it once did best: focusing on product, rebuilding retail relationships, partnering closely with athletes, and returning to a pull market model.\n\nThe shift is already showing up in bold marketing moves. Nike just ran its first Super Bowl ad since 1998, spending $16 million on the campaign. They signed Caitlin Clark, the biggest name in women’s basketball, to a $28 million deal. And — this one hits especially close to home — they signed a $700 million sponsorship deal with the German national football team, ending a 70-year partnership with Adidas.\n\nBeyond bold marketing moves, Hill is also shifting focus away from the volume game that defined Donahoe’s DTC strategy. His goal is to re-establish Nike Direct as a premium destination — not just a high-traffic sales channel. He’s been clear: Nike became too promotional in recent years.\n\nNow, Nike isn’t a luxury brand, but it has always carried a premium image. And if you read our Moncler newsletter, you’ll remember why excessive discounting can damage that kind of brand equity.\n\nIt didn’t just hurt Nike’s image — it hurt retailers, too. Whenever Nike slashed prices, retailers were forced to follow suit just to stay competitive. That strained relationships and further complicated Nike’s wholesale reset.\n\nBut that chapter’s behind them — at least in intention. Since taking over, Hill has been on the road nonstop, visiting wholesalers, Nike factories, and athletes around the world. His message? “We have to earn our way back to the shelves.”\n\nBut that was October. So now the big question is: How’s the “Win Now” strategy going?\n\n**Recent Results — Win Later?**\n\nWell, there’s not much that suggests Nike is “winning now” — at least if you’re looking strictly at the numbers.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, sales declined 9% overall, with drops across every brand, region, and sales channel. Gross margin took a heavy hit, falling 330 basis points (3.3 percentage points) to 41.5%. And if you looked at the EPS and thought, “Well, that’s not that bad,” keep in mind: it was propped up by a 10% drop in the effective tax rate — a one-off that helped polish otherwise rough results.\n\nSo, why is Elliott Hill’s confidence “reinforced”? Why does he say Nike is on “the right path”? Is he seeing different numbers than the rest of us?\n\nI don’t think so. And believe it or not, I actually don’t dislike the recent trends as much as the headlines suggest.\n\nYes — the results are not good. And they’re even going to get worse. Nike’s guidance for Q4 includes mid-teen revenue declines and a 5% drop in gross margins.\n\nBut here’s the thing: the Win Now strategy was never meant to deliver short-term wins. Hill made that clear from the beginning. He said his plan would hurt the numbers in the short run, but he’s taking the long-term view. I know, calling it “Win Now” is a bit of a lie then. But honestly, would you call your strategy “Win Later?”\n\nOne of Hill’s first major tasks was reducing Nike’s inventory problem. After pandemic-era supply shocks eased, a flood of delayed product hit Nike all at once, leaving them with several seasons’ worth of inventory. Fixing that was going to hurt. But it was necessary.\n\nRetail brands like Nike suffer tremendously when inventory levels get out of control. It clogs up the cash flow statement — you’ve already spent the money to make the product, but you're not getting paid because it’s just sitting there. The longer it sits, the more working capital is tied up and the higher the carrying costs.\n\nBut clearing that inventory also comes at a cost. You have to discount heavily to move product quickly, which not only hurts margins but also dilutes the brand and strains retailer relationships.\n\nHopefully, by now, you can see how everything we’ve discussed — from the DTC pivot to product missteps and retailer tension — fed into this reinforcing cycle that’s been dragging Nike down.\n\nAnd speaking of things hurting Nike…We can’t ignore the most recent development — the one that crushed the stock by 15%, only for it to bounce right back a few days later. You probably know what I’m talking about: Tariff mania.\n\n\n\n**The Impact of Tariffs on Nike**\n\nThe U.S. recently announced a new round of tariffs on imports from Vietnam — a country where Nike now produces over 50% of its footwear and nearly 30% of its apparel.\n\nDepending on how Nike responds — whether by absorbing the cost, passing it on to consumers, or renegotiating with suppliers — the impact could vary widely. But in all scenarios, there’s potential for weakened demand and further pressure on margins.\n\nThere are no precise estimates yet on how Nike’s financials might be affected. Some industry experts suggest shoes that currently retail for $150 could rise to $220–$230, a range that likely assumes the full cost of tariffs is passed on to consumers.\n\nBut in reality, that may not be feasible. Pushing prices that high risks damaging demand, especially in an already soft consumer environment. On the other hand, if Nike absorbs the cost, margins would take a substantial hit. Each option comes with trade-offs, and none of them are easy.\n\nFor now, the situation remains uncertain. Reciprocal tariffs from Vietnam have been paused for 90 days, and initial talks between the U.S. and Vietnam have already taken place. But until there’s more clarity, the uncertainty remains yet another headwind for a business already in reset mode.\n\n\n\n**Valuing the Swoosh**\n\nWe’ve now covered Nike’s strengths — and its many current challenges: declining sales, margin pressure, inventory cleanup, and a strategy reset that will take time. So, when it comes to valuation, I try to reflect all of that — while knowing full well that the more precise a model tries to be, the more likely it is to be wrong.\n\nStill, here’s the thinking behind my assumptions.\n\nBefore the recent tariff announcements, Q4 was already expected to be the low point, with management guiding for mid-teen revenue declines and another 450 basis point drop in gross margin. Now, with added uncertainty from the tariff situation, I remain cautious even beyond that.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, I assume a 15% revenue decline and an operating margin of 6.5% — down 5.5 points from 2024 and the lowest in over a decade.\n\nBefore reciprocal tariffs were announced, I assumed a gradual recovery: 5% revenue growth and a 10.5% margin by 2030. Even under those more optimistic assumptions, Nike would have only returned to its 2024 earnings by the end of the decade.\n\nGiven everything that’s changed, I’ve now revised those numbers: Just 2% annual revenue growth and a 2030 operating margin of 9%. That would mean that, even five years out, operating margins would be lower than at any point in the last decade, except for 8.3% in 2020 when the Covid pandemic hit.\n\nFrom there, I total Nike’s expected earnings per share and dividends, apply a range of exit multiples, and assign probabilities to reflect different long-term scenarios. No one knows what multiple investors will pay five years from now, but this gives some structure to that uncertainty.\n\nDiscounted back at 8%, the model suggests a fair value of $63 per share — roughly 16.5% above today’s price of $54.\n\nDon’t focus too much on the precise numbers here. For me, the key takeaway is that even if I assume a very grim outlook for the next five years, Nike’s current price seems attractive. Considering the dividend and the buybacks, your total shareholder return, depending on the exit multiple, could look like this (historic P/E between 25-28):\n\nYes, the outlook is cloudy. Yes, more tariff headlines could push the stock lower. But from a long-term perspective, this entry point looks increasingly attractive. \n\nThe bottom line: if you still believe in Nike’s brand, scale, and staying power, the stock offers solid upside from here (i.e., low-to-mid double-digit expected returns annually with very cautious assumptions, looking out 5 years or so)— especially if the turnaround gains traction and the tariffs end up as negotiating leverage, not a long-term policy.\n\nI write free newsletters breaking down different companies like this every week, and I've covered companies like Alphabet, John Deere, Coupang, Airbnb, Ulta, Nintendo, and Hershey's — to see my full archive of company write-ups (for free) or to subscribe and get these posts shared directly with you weekly, visit [this page](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/newsletters/?utm_source=Reddit).

        "selftext": "Hey, lately I have been asking questions about stocks here, and I get such good insights and analysis. Today I wanted to ask you your favorite stock and a quick analysis about it. \n\nI have done my homework and here is mine for this week: **TSM**, might enter again if I find a good entry point. Your turn giveme your best shot!!! \n\n\n\n**MY TSM ANALYSIS:** \n\n**\\*Business Overview:\\*** \n\nTSMC is the world's leading pure-play semiconductor foundry, commanding a 67% market share in contract chip manufacturing and over 90% in advanced chip production. Key clients include Nvidia and Apple. The company is pioneering next-generation 2nm and 1.6nm technologies and investing heavily in global expansion, including a $165 billion commitment to U.S. facilities.\n\n**\\*Growth:\\*** \n\nTSMC has demonstrated strong growth, with a historical Revenue CAGR of 33.9% and EPS CAGR of 37.8%. Q1 2025 revenue surged 41.6% year-over-year, with April 2025 growth reaching 48%. Analysts project a forward growth rate of 60.3%, driven by a forecasted 45% CAGR in AI-related chip demand. TSMC anticipates near-20% revenue CAGR over the next five years. This growth is supported by significant capital investments and the planned launch of advanced 2nm and 1.6nm chips in 2025-2026.\n\n**\\*Profitability:\\*** \n\nTSMC exhibits robust profitability, reflecting its market dominance. Q1 2025 gross margin was 58.8%, and operating margin reached 48.5%, contributing to a 60% year-over-year net profit increase to NT$361.56 billion (43% net margin). Key profitability metrics include a high Return on Invested Capital, a 30% Return on Equity, and TTM Free Cash Flow of NT$870.17 billion.\n\n**\\*Moat:\\*** \n\nTSMC possesses a wide economic moat underpinned by its technological leadership and scale. Its 60-90% market share in advanced chip production, combined with superior process yields (e.g., 2nm and 3nm), makes it an essential, neutral foundry partner for major tech companies. The significant capital expenditures required for advanced fabrication facilities, exemplified by the $100+ billion U.S. expansion, create a substantial barrier to entry.\n\n**\\*Performance & Sentiment:\\***\n\nTSM has delivered strong long-term performance, with the stock up over 200% in the past five years and 20% in the last year. Following a 23% year-to-date decline, the stock has recently rebounded nearly 20% in the past month and broken above its 50-week moving average, signaling a bullish trend. Analyst consensus remains a \"Strong Buy,\" with average target prices around $219.43, indicating significant upside potential. While geopolitical risks and evolving U.S. trade policies remain factors, TSMC's crucial role in meeting AI-driven chip demand and attractive valuation support positive investor sentiment.\n\n",

This only proves my thesis that I am bearish on Google.\n\n**TL,DR/Intro:** Gemini and AI overview numbers are separate, this user didn't do any research & based their opinion on anecdotal comments instead of looking at data. My own personal *opinion* is that Google is currently winning the AI race, and will win in the future, as they simply have access to more compute and models which offer more/equal performance for similar/lower cost of compute. In addition, as others have mentioned, Google has a far greater variety of platforms with which they can integrate Gemini into, further incentivizing usage of the Google product suite and google ecosystem.\n\n**Going deeper (Showing evidence):**\n\nGemini app usage is \\~350 million users a month: [https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/)\n\n>Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot, had 350 million monthly active users around the globe as of March, according to internal data revealed in Google’s ongoing antitrust suit.\n\nAI Overviews usage is \\~1.5 billion users a month, under \"Search\" subheading: [https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q1-2025/#search](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q1-2025/#search)\n\n>In Search, we saw continued double digit revenue growth. AI Overviews is going very well with over 1.5 billion users per month, and we’re excited by the early positive reaction to AI Mode.\n\nGemini vs ChatGPT benchmarks: [https://livebench.ai/#/](https://livebench.ai/#/)\n\n* For this, compare Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google's most powerful reasoning model) to o3 High (OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model): 78 Overall vs 80 Overall\n* And compare Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google's faster, more affordable model) to o4-mini medium (OpenAI's more affordable model). 72 vs 74.5 overall\n* However, a more fair comparison would be between the models free users can get with Google and OpenAI. For Google, free users get access to Gemini 2.5 Pro & Flash, while free users for ChatGPT only get limited access to ChatGPT-4o (Overall 64.65 score).\n* Sources: [https://chatgpt.com/#pricing](https://chatgpt.com/#pricing), and [https://platform.openai.com/docs/models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for how I drew the comparisons.\n\n**Gemini vs ChatGPT Compute Costs**: Gemini compute costs for Google are far less than OpenAI's, demonstrating Google has more cost-efficient models, important for scalability and profitability down the line.

        "title": "The Very Last: Occidental Petroleum Investment Thesis",
        "selftext": "Dear Redditors,\n\nIn this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.\n\nLet me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…\n\n**What happens when oil prices are high?**\n\nWell, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).\n\nThe redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.\n\nAt the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \\~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said \"this makes sense\" during his annual shareholder meeting.\n\nSo in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).\n\n**What happens when oil prices are low?**\n\nThis is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.\n\n(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. \n\n(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. \n\n(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \\~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That's a noticible amount if it were to going missing, compared to smaller players. Overall, the US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices (geopolitics in part) and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies. Oh, and the Saudi's tried to kill US shale, but failed. Turns out, at the end of the day, economies need their fiscal budgets to balance... except for the US who controls the dollar.\n\n(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy. That said, a tighter mid-cycle range of oil prices is in everyone's best interest.\n\n(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks and decreasing the amount of lendable shares (up to 50%) could help price stability. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.\n\n**What does that leave for the rest of us?**\n\nAssuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.\n\nNow, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.\n\nSome quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).\n\nSo it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?\n\nBelieve it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”\n\nCrazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.\n\nOXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: \n\n1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)\n2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration\n\nI’ll start with the less controversial one…\n\n**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**\n\nIf you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed **ELON MUSK** (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart as Simbol Materials’ commanded a billion dollar valuation (**Jefferies valued them at $2.5 Billion**). Tesla investors familiar with the matter, know that they did not have a billion dollars to throw around at the time. And months later Simbol Materials went bust.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**\n\nThe 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being \"too general\" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and Occidental Petroleum has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech. Let's just say, in a weird twist, the potential Tesla backed Simbol Materials is now backed by Occidental Petroleum and Berkshire Hathaway Energy via a subsidiary called TerraLithium.\n\nAny regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.\n\n**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor (not the only though).**\n\nI have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million on assets that were once valued at **$2.5 billion in 2014 by Jefferies** \\-- with a stronger team now, than 10 years ago. Eventually, they plan on licensing this tech, and let's just say, owning the patents to the tech that can extract half the current global production is probably worth something. And of course lithium prices matter, but the tech is a fixed cost that would be shielded from the *cyclicality* of lithium prices.\n\nNow, onto the more controversial one…\n\n**1PointFive: Carbon Management**\n\nAnti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.\n\nOn May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. \n\nIn the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:\n\n>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.  \nFor a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”\n\nVicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nHowever, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.\n\nThe painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. \n\nLuckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:\n\n>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”\n\nLearning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.\n\n>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.  \nThese synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”\n\nAlong with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.\n\nThe main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.\n\nDespite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.\n\nHowever, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:\n\n>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.  \nThese buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.  \nAs for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”\n\nAt full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. \n\nHowever, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:\n\n1.

To reverse climate change, carbon needs to be removed from the air.\n\n*That is a fact.*\n\nThere are a handful of startups that remove carbon from the air, but their solutions can only remove **tens** of thousands of metric tons. To be blunt, all of their solutions are subscale and fall short of even putting a dent into reversing climate change.\n\nHowever, Stratos' scale is to the tune of **hundreds** of thousands. At full capacity, Stratos can remove \\~500,000 metric tons of carbon per year while running on green energy.\n\n*Stratos' scale blows out the competition by over 10 times the capacity.*\n\nAnd unlike trees, OXY *can* optimize DAC plants to be built, smaller, cheaper, and faster. If this tech improves, it would only take a few thousand of these DAC plants to reverse climate change.\n\n*OXY, via their subsidiary 1Point5, is both well capitlized and vertically integrated to scale DAC and fight climate change.*\n\n**History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.**\n\nCrazy or not, I believe buying OXY now is like buying Nvidia.\n\nNvidia’s GPUs have proven various use cases from gaming, crypto, to AI, where the core gaming business was rather unattractive.\n\n*Before Nvidia's enormous run, analysts valued Nvidia's GPUs potential in crypto and AI at basically 0.*\n\nSimilarly, OXY’s expertise in carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech has proven various use cases from carbon based enhanced oil recovery, lithium extraction, carbon sequestration, and carbon removal tech.\n\n*Currently analysts value Direct Lithium Extraction tech and a transtion to Carbon Management at 0.* \n\nWhat baffles me is that Nvidia’s growth is fueled by **speculative demand** for crypto and artificial intelligence. The world has yet to see returns, but plans on spending $1 trillion over the next few years on AI hoping the economics will work out.\n\n*If that isn’t speculation, I don’t know what is.*\n\nAnd believe me, I understand this tech more than you ever would think. A colleague of mine who has a PhD in CS told me exactly the many use cases of GPUs, but I didn't buy it because: (1) I viewed AI as speculative. (2) Because of reason 1, I expected companies to invest slowly and cautiously. I mean, just look at how the market reacted to Mark Zuckerberg's push into the Metaverse. (3) Because of reason 1 and 2, I expected a slow growth rate where Nvidia's moat would erode in a 3 to 5 year time frame to competitors (something that is happening as we speak -- i.e. CUDA on AMD) before Nvidia could make a killing.\n\nIn fact, my stance on tech in general can be summarized as so:\n\n>The reality of tech companies is that they age rapidly — like dog years squared. Moats flash in and out of existence within 2 to 3 years time (along with their valuations). The odds of finding the next Oracle are slim to none, because it's almost certain that the world will never rely on a single relational database architecture again. The main worries in tech are competition, growth, value-cre-ation, and value-ation. When competition enters the space, investors should pack their bags since the rapid democratization of information allows competition to grow at lightning speeds. Ironically, the forever holdings are businesses that are entrenched usually for non-technological reasons (i.e Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, Palantir). And lack of technical and algorithmic literacy, makes the chances of accurately determining an enduring business at early stages next to none.\n\nWith the release of ChatGPT, you can imagine where I went wrong... At that point, I should've just bought the damn company since the growth was obviously higher than I anticipated completely invalidating my original thoughts. But I digress, the focus of this letter isn't about me confessing my sins for missing out on Nvidia...\n\nNvidia aside, Occidental Petroleum’s growth is fueled by **non-speculative demand**:\n\n(1) Lithium independence is a bipartisan goal, and lithium demand is very healthy with our tech boom.\n\n(2) Climate change keeps getting worse. Reducing emission slows it, but to reversing it requires the atmosphere to be decarbonized which is a very healthy tailwind for a growing carbon credit market that OXY can dominate.\n\n(3) Due to oil being sytemically ingrained into the world, the clean energy transition is very slow. So I can sleep knowing that tomorrow oil will still be here.\n\nOverall, I buy whenever OXY nears ***single*** digit earnings multiples or reaches an acceptable free cash flow yield (adjusted for things I deem reasonable like Warren's preferred shares, because there’s cash flow and then there’s cash flow I get).\n\nFor me OXY is a safe vehicle to park my money while I wait for other opportunities. And until then, I will just be clipping coupons.\n\nSo yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...\n\nFrom,\n\nYetAnotherSpeculator\n\n\\#NotFinancialAdvice\n\n**\\[Amendment; January 27, 2025\\]** Please re-read my stance on tech. In a mere 2 years AI investment, we are at a crossroads with Nvidia v.s. DeepSeek. I believe this letter speaks for itself. As for what's going to happen?  I have no fucking clue, but I do not believe natural market forces are in play.\n\n**\\[Amendment; April 9, 2025\\]** In an ironic turn of events, an orange man is shilling EVs and about to tank US shale. So much for \"Drill, baby drill.\" Now, I have no doubt that lower oil prices equals less oil production. **But, if US shale falters, there will be massive ramifications**. There is a reason why the stock market is declining rapidly. There is an old man fondling economic nukes, putting the world on the brink of economic instability we have not seen since the pandemic. The fear is real, and opportunity is already appearing. Perhaps there's a reason why Berkshire was making small bets on beer, pizza, and pools... in any event, depending on how long these tarriffs persist, US shale is one of the last places you want to be...\n\n**\\[Amendment; May 14, 2025\\]** As Warren Buffett said himself, this market volatility is nothing. Had you seen my revisions, I swung massive handsomely into a small oil company in the state of California and let’s just say have done quite well since during this recovery. As for where i put those gains, OXY is neither on nor off the table, but other opportunities can and will exist. oil is a commodity and volatile, but it works in both directions. but one thing won’t change and that’s how important OXY is to reducing the deficit…\n\n**\\[Amendment; June 15, 2025\\]** From doom and gloom tariff induced oil price winter, to Israel has targeting Iran energy infrastructure, only time will tell where oil prices go. In the meantime, OXY is making steady progress right sizing the balance sheet and it’s carbon management initiatives. Though the trailing P/E is nothing to scoff at… overall i would use P/E as a proxy, given how volatile a commodity like oil is…",
