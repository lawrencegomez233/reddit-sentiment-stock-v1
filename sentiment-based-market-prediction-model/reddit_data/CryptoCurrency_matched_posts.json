Instead, I’m getting a lot of private messages from people who say they’re interested in buying the cards. I’m wondering if this is typical when selling gift cards online, or if it’s a sign that I should be cautious. I’ve heard that scammers often reach out privately, sometimes pretending to be legitimate buyers, and then try to get the card codes or personal information before actually sending payment. I’d really appreciate any advice or stories from others who have tried to sell Apple gift cards—did you also get mostly private messages, and how did you determine if the buyers were trustworthy? I want to avoid falling for any scams, especially since I’ve read that once you share the codes, the money can be gone for good. What steps can I take to protect myself and make sure I’m dealing with real buyers? Any tips or recommended platforms for selling safely would be really helpful.",

        "selftext": "If you invest in crypto, you cannot say you’ve done your research unless you’ve read this thesis on tokenization, published by Larry Fink today in the annual investor letter for BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager.\n\nFor context, BlackRock manages over $11 Trillion in assets and is one of the top shareholders in just about any company you’ve ever heard of. They led the launch of Bitcoin ETFs followed by Ethereum ETFs. They launched their BUIDL fund for on-chain asset management, which has already surpassed over $2B in AUM on Ethereum.\n\nDo yourself a favor and read it below:\n\n**Tokenization is democratization**\n\nThe world’s money moves through plumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary.\nTake the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). It’s the system that underpins trillions of dollars in global transactions every day, and it works much like a relay race: Banks hand off instructions one by one, meticulously checking details at each step. That relay approach made sense in the 1970s, an analog era when the markets were much smaller and daily transactions were much fewer. But today, relying on SWIFT feels like routing emails through the postal office.\n\nTokenization changes all that. If SWIFT is the postal service, tokenization is email itself—assets move directly and instantly, sidestepping intermediaries.\n\nWhat exactly is tokenization? It's turning real-world assets—stocks, bonds, real estate—into digital tokens tradable online. Each token certifies your ownership of a specific asset, much like a digital deed. Unlike traditional paper certificates, these tokens live securely on a blockchain, enabling instant buying, selling, and transferring without cumbersome paperwork or waiting periods.\n\nEvery stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn't need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, tokenization makes investing much more democratic.\n\n- **It can democratize access.**\nTokenization allows for fractional ownership. That means assets could be sliced into infinitely small pieces. This lowers one of the barriers to investing in valuable, previously inaccessible assets like private real estate and private equity.\n\n- **It can democratize shareholder voting.**\nWhen you own a stock, you have a right to vote on the company’s shareholder proposals. Tokenization makes that easier because your ownership and voting rights are digitally tracked, allowing you to vote seamlessly and securely from anywhere.\n\n- **It can democratize yield.**\nSome investments produce much higher returns than others, but only big investors can get into them. One reason? Friction. Legal, operational, bureaucratic. Tokenization strips that away, allowing more people access to potentially higher returns.\n\n**One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs—provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification.**\n\nFinancial transactions demand rigorous identity checks. Apple Pay and credit cards handle identity verification effortlessly, billions of times a day. Trade venues like NYSE and MarketAxess manage to do the same for buying and selling securities. But tokenized assets won’t run through those traditional channels, meaning we need a new digital identity verification system. It sounds complex, but India, the world’s most populous country, has already done it. Today, over 90% of Indians can securely verify transactions directly from their smartphones. The takeaway is clear. If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. We must solve digital verification, too.",

Especially concerning the major question of how to handle legacy addresses, whose public keys have been exposed, making them vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer in the future. All that while Google and Apple are proactively implementing the new quantum-safe NIST-approved algorithms already.\n\nHim saying „It‘s the hardest thing in the universe to hack“ just gives me „The titanic cannot be sunk“ kind of vibes. And saying it’s encryption is stronger than Google is just a straight-up lie.\n\nI can’t imagine he is not aware of all this, which makes me really question his authenticity in the Bitcoin community. It should be in his interest to make Bitcoin future-proof in order to secure the protocol and its investors. And he, as the face of Bitcoin, should take the leading role in ensuring that Bitcoin will reach its goal to be the future store-of-value and replace gold instead of downplaying potential future threats.",

        "selftext": "Hey r/Cryptocurrency community, I’m Tony, the founder of Obyte. Happy to introduce you to Obyte, if you’ve never heard about it, or heard too long ago.\n\nObyte is a DAG based cryptocurrency platform. What makes it different from other platforms is that power is decentralized here. Due to being based on DAG (Directed acyclic graph), every user in Obyte has the power to add their transactions directly to the ledger, with no middlemen involved. This is different from blockchains, where block producers are the power centers and middlemen that have the power to accept or not accept transactions into their blocks (to censor them).\n\nObyte stays true to the original cypherpunk and crypto-anarchist values of individual autonomy, independence from big power centers, and privacy. For me, that was what drew me to crypto when I first got involved in 2014. Unfortunately, now it seems to have lost its way and shifted to getting-rich-quick, institutional money, ETFs, and hyper-financialization.\n\nWe want to get crypto back to its cypherpunk roots.\n\nTo rebuild the community centered around these values we recently launched a cypherpunk-themed Obyte City, where community members establish closer connections with one another when they become neighbors in the City (along with earning some rewards). The idea is that stronger horizontal connections — independent of the team — make a stronger community.

It fell to my friend and colleague Rafail Ostrovsky to organize the workshop, which ended up being held last week. When Rafi invited me to give the opening talk, I knew he’d keep emailing until I said yes. So, on the 3-hour flight to LAX, I wrote the following talk in a spiral notebook, which I then delivered the next morning with no slides. I called it “Quantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype.” I thought Shtetl-Optimized readers might be interested too, since it contains my reflections on a quarter-century in quantum computing, and prognostications on what I expect soon. Enjoy, and let me know what you think!\n\n\n\nQuantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype\n\nby Scott Aaronson\n\nSeptember 16, 2024\n\n\n\nWhen Rafi invited me to open this event, it sounded like he wanted big-picture pontification more than technical results, which is just as well, since I’m getting old for the latter. Also, I’m just now getting back into quantum computing after a two-year leave at OpenAI to think about the theoretical foundations of AI safety. Luckily for me, that was a relaxing experience, since not much happened in AI these past two years. \\[Pause for laughs\\] So then, did anything happen in quantum computing while I was away?\n\n\n\nThis, of course, has been an extraordinary time for both quantum computing and AI, and not only because the two fields were mentioned for the first time in an American presidential debate (along with, I think, the problem of immigrants eating pets). But it’s extraordinary for quantum computing and for AI in very different ways. In AI, practice is wildly ahead of theory, and there’s a race for scientific understanding to catch up to where we’ve gotten via the pure scaling of neural nets and the compute and data used to train them. In quantum computing, it’s just the opposite: there’s right now a race for practice to catch up to where theory has been since the mid-1990s.\n\n\n\nI started in quantum computing around 1998, which is not quite as long as some people here, but which does cover most of the time since Shor’s algorithm and the rest were discovered. So I can say: this past year or two is the first time I’ve felt like the race to build a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer is actually underway. Like people are no longer merely giving talks about the race or warming up for the race, but running the race.\n\n\n\nWithin just the last few weeks, we saw the group at Google announce that they’d used the Kitaev surface code, with distance 7, to encode one logical qubit using 100 or so physical qubits, in superconducting architecture. They got a net gain: their logical qubit stays alive for maybe twice as long as the underlying physical qubits do. And crucially, they find that their logical coherence time increases as they pass to larger codes, with higher distance, on more physical qubits. With superconducting, there are still limits to how many physical qubits you can stuff onto a chip, and eventually you’ll need communication of qubits between chips, which has yet to be demonstrated. But if you could scale Google’s current experiment even to 1500 physical qubits, you’d probably be below the threshold where you could use that as a building block for a future scalable fault-tolerant device.\n\n\n\nThen, just last week, a collaboration between Microsoft and Quantinuum announced that, in the trapped-ion architecture, they applied pretty substantial circuits to logically-encoded qubits—-again in a way that gets a net gain in fidelity over not doing error-correction, modulo a debate about whether they’re relying too much on postselection. So, they made a GHZ state, which is basically like a Schrödinger cat, out of 12 logically encoded qubits. They also did a “quantum chemistry simulation,” which had only two logical qubits, but which required three logical non-Clifford gates—which is the hard kind of gate when you’re doing error-correction.\n\n\n\nBecause of these advances, as well as others—what QuEra is doing with neutral atoms, what PsiQuantum and Xanadu are doing with photonics, etc.—I’m now more optimistic than I’ve ever been that, if things continue at the current rate, either there are useful fault-tolerant QCs in the next decade, or else something surprising happens to stop that. Plausibly we’ll get there not just with one hardware architecture, but with multiple ones, much like the Manhattan Project got a uranium bomb and a plutonium bomb around the same time, so the question will become which one is most economic.\n\n\n\nIf someone asks me why I’m now so optimistic, the core of the argument is 2-qubit gate fidelities. We’ve known for years that, at least on paper, quantum fault-tolerance becomes a net win (that is, you sustainably correct errors faster than you introduce new ones) once you have physical 2-qubit gates that are \\~99.99% reliable. The problem has “merely” been how far we were from that. When I entered the field, in the late 1990s, it would’ve been like a Science or Nature paper to do a 2-qubit gate with 50% fidelity. But then at some point the 50% became 90%, became 95%, became 99%, and within the past year, multiple groups have reported 99.9%. So, if you just plot the log of the infidelity as a function of year and stare at it—yeah, you’d feel pretty optimistic about the next decade too!\n\n\n\nOr pessimistic, as the case may be! To any of you who are worried about post-quantum cryptography—by now I’m so used to delivering a message of, maybe, eventually, someone will need to start thinking about migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack. I think today that message needs to change. I think today the message needs to be: yes, unequivocally, worry about this now. Have a plan.\n\n\n\nSo, I think this moment is a good one for reflection. We’re used to quantum computing having this air of unreality about it. Like sure, we go to conferences, we prove theorems about these complexity classes like BQP and QMA, the experimenters do little toy demos that don’t scale. But if this will ever be practical at all, then for all we know, not for another 200 years. It feels really different to think of this as something plausibly imminent. So what I want to do for the rest of this talk is to step back and ask, what are the main reasons why people regarded this as not entirely real? And what can we say about those reasons in light of where we are today?\n\n\n\nReason #1\n\n\n\nFor the general public, maybe the overriding reason not to take QC seriously has just been that it sounded too good to be true. Like, great, you’ll have this magic machine that’s gonna exponentially speed up every problem in optimization and machine learning and finance by trying out every possible solution simultaneously, in different parallel universes. Does it also dice peppers?\n\n\n\nFor this objection, I’d say that our response hasn’t changed at all in 30 years, and it’s simply, “No, that’s not what it will do and not how it will work.” We should acknowledge that laypeople and journalists and unfortunately even some investors and government officials have been misled by the people whose job it was to explain this stuff to them.\n\n\n\nI think it’s important to tell people that the only hope of getting a speedup from a QC is to exploit the way that QM works differently from classical probability theory — in particular, that it involves these numbers called amplitudes, which can be positive, negative, or even complex. With every quantum algorithm, what you’re trying to do is choreograph a pattern of interference where for each wrong answer, the contributions to its amplitude cancel each other out, whereas the contributions to the amplitude of the right answer reinforce each other. The trouble is, it’s only for a few practical problems that we know how to do that in a way that vastly outperforms the best known classical algorithms.\n\n\n\nWhat are those problems? Here, for all the theoretical progress that’s been made in these past decades, I’m going to give the same answer in 2024 that I would’ve given in 1998. Namely, there’s the simulation of chemistry, materials, nuclear physics, or anything else where many-body quantum effects matter. This was Feynman’s original application from 1981, but probably still the most important one commercially. It could plausibly help with batteries, drugs, solar cells, high-temperature superconductors, all kinds of other things, maybe even in the next few years.\n\n\n\nAnd then there’s breaking public-key cryptography, which is not commercially important, but is important for other reasons well-known to everyone here.\n\n\n\nAnd then there’s everything else. For problems in optimization, machine learning, finance, and so on, there’s typically a Grover’s speedup, but that of course is “only” a square root and not an exponential, which means that it will take much longer before it’s relevant in practice. And one of the earliest things we learned in quantum computing theory is that there’s no “black-box” way to beat the Grover speedup. By the way, that’s also relevant to breaking cryptography — other than the subset of cryptography that’s based on abelian groups and can be broken by Shor’s algorithm or the like. The centerpiece of my PhD thesis, twenty years ago, was the theorem that you can’t get more than a Grover-type polynomial speedup for the black-box problem of finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions.\n\n\n\nSo then what remains? Well, there are all sorts heuristic quantum algorithms for classical optimization and machine learning problems — QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), quantum annealing, and so on — and we can hope that sometimes they’ll beat the best classical heuristics for the same problems, but it will be trench warfare, not just magically speeding up everything. There are lots of quantum algorithms somehow inspired by the HHL (Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd) algorithm for solving linear systems, and we can hope that some of those algorithms will get exponential speedups for end-to-end problems that matter, as opposed to problems of transforming one quantum state to another quantum state. We can of course hope that new quantum algorithms will be discovered. And most of all, we can look for entirely new problem domains, where people hadn’t even considered using quantum computers before—new orchards in which to pick low-hanging fruit. Recently, Shih-Han Hung and I, along with others, have proposed using current QCs to generate cryptographically certified random numbers, which could be used in post-state cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. I’m hopeful that people will find other protocol applications of QC like that one — “proof of quantum work.” \\[Another major potential protocol application, which Dan Boneh brought up after my talk, is quantum one-shot signatures.\\]\n\n\n\nAnyway, taken together, I don’t think any of this is too good to be true. I think it’s genuinely good and probably true!\n\n\n\nReason #2\n\n\n\nA second reason people didn’t take seriously that QC was actually going to happen was the general thesis of technological stagnation, at least in the physical world. You know, maybe in the 40s and 50s, humans built entirely new types of machines, but nowadays what do we do? We issue press releases. We make promises. We argue on social media.\n\n\n\nNowadays, of course, pessimism about technological progress seems hard to square with the revolution that’s happening in AI, another field that spent decades being ridiculed for unfulfilled promises and that’s now fulfilling the promises. I’d also speculate that, to the extent there is technological stagnation, most of it is simply that it’s become really hard to build new infrastructure—high-speed rail, nuclear power plants, futuristic cities—for legal reasons and NIMBY reasons and environmental review reasons and Baumol’s cost disease reasons. But none of that really applies to QC, just like it hasn’t applied so far to AI.\n\n\n\nReason #3\n\n\n\nA third reason people didn’t take this seriously was the sense of “It’s been 20 years already, where’s my quantum computer?” QC is often compared to fusion power, another technology that’s “eternally just over the horizon.” (Except, I’m no expert, but there seems to be dramatic progress these days in fusion power too!)\n\n\n\nMy response to the people who make that complaint was always, like, how much do you know about the history of technology? It took more than a century for heavier-than-air flight to go from correct statements of the basic principle to reality. Universal programmable classical computers surely seemed more fantastical from the standpoint of 1920 than quantum computers seem today, but then a few decades later they were built. Today, AI provides a particularly dramatic example where ideas were proposed a long time ago—neural nets, backpropagation—those ideas were then written off as failures, but no, we now know that the ideas were perfectly sound; it just took a few decades for the scaling of hardware to catch up to the ideas. That’s why this objection never had much purchase by me, even before the dramatic advances in experimental quantum error-correction of the last year or two.\n\n\n\nReason #4\n\n\n\nA fourth reason why people didn’t take QC seriously is that, a century after the discovery of QM, some people still harbor doubts about quantum mechanics itself. Either they explicitly doubt it, like Leonid Levin, Roger Penrose, or Gerard ‘t Hooft. Or they say things like, “complex Hilbert space in 2n dimensions is a nice mathematical formalism, but mathematical formalism is not reality”—the kind of thing you say when you want to doubt, but not take full intellectual responsibility for your doubts.\n\n\n\nI think the only thing for us to say in response, as quantum computing researchers—and the thing I consistently have said—is man, we welcome that confrontation! Let’s test quantum mechanics in this new regime. And if, instead of building a QC, we have to settle for “merely” overthrowing quantum mechanics and opening up a new era in physics—well then, I guess we’ll have to find some way to live with that.\n\n\n\nReason #5\n\n\n\nMy final reason why people didn’t take QC seriously is the only technical one I’ll discuss here. Namely, maybe quantum mechanics is fine but fault-tolerant quantum computing is fundamentally “screened off” or “censored” by decoherence or noise—and maybe the theory of quantum fault-tolerance, which seemed to indicate the opposite, makes unjustified assumptions. This has been the position of Gil Kalai, for example.\n\n\n\nThe challenge for that position has always been to articulate, what is true about the world instead? Can every realistic quantum system be simulated efficiently by a classical computer? If so, how? What is a model of correlated noise that kills QC without also killing scalable classical computing?—which turns out to be a hard problem.\n\n\n\nIn any case, I think this position has been dealt a severe blow by the Random Circuit Sampling quantum supremacy experiments of the past five years. Scientifically, the most important thing we’ve learned from these experiments is that the fidelity seems to decay exponentially with the number of qubits, but “only” exponentially — as it would if the errors were independent from one gate to the next, precisely as the theory of quantum fault-tolerance assumes. So for anyone who believes this objection, I’d say that the ball is now firmly in their court.\n\n\n\nSo, if we accept that QC is on the threshold of becoming real, what are the next steps? There are the obvious ones: push forward with building better hardware and using it to demonstrate logical qubits and fault-tolerant operations on them. Continue developing better error-correction methods. Continue looking for new quantum algorithms and new problems for those algorithms to solve.\n\n\n\nBut there’s also a less obvious decision right now. Namely, do we put everything into fault-tolerant qubits, or do we continue trying to demonstrate quantum advantage in the NISQ (pre-fault-tolerant) era? There’s a case to be made that fault-tolerance will ultimately be needed for scaling, and anything you do without fault-tolerance is some variety of non-scalable circus trick, so we might as well get over the hump now.\n\n\n\nBut I’d like to advocate putting at least some thought into how to demonstrate a quantum advantage in the near-term. Thay could be via cryptographic protocols, like those that Kahanamoku-Meyer et al. have proposed. It could be via pseudorandom peaked quantum circuits, a recent proposal by me and Yuxuan Zhang—if we can figure out an efficient way to generate the circuits. Or we could try to demonstrate what William Kretschmer, Harry Buhrman, and I have called “quantum information supremacy,” where, instead of computational advantage, you try to do an experiment that directly shows the vastness of Hilbert space, via exponential advantages for quantum communication complexity, for example. I’m optimistic that that might be doable in the very near future, and have been working with Quantinuum to try to do it.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, when I started in quantum computing 25 years ago, I reconciled myself to the prospect that I’m going to study what fundamental physics implies about the limits of computation, and maybe I’ll never live to see any of it experimentally tested, and that’s fine. On the other hand, once you tell me that there is a serious prospect of testing it soon, then I become kind of impatient. Some part of me says, let’s do this! Let’s try to achieve forthwith what I’ve always regarded as the #1 application of quantum computers, more important than codebreaking or even quantum simulation: namely, disproving the people who said that scalable quantum computing was impossible.",

The more people involved in crypto, the quicker it becomes mainstream and prices grow even higher. Just a quick glance on the internet and billions of crypto is still being hacked and stolen each year. \n\nThis is concerning to someone who is moving $6-7 figures in crypto to store in a wallet or cold storage. I lost $13k in 2020 or so by having random coins I had to sell then convert to this token from that token to cash out in cash. I sent coins from a wrong coin to another coin address and I was SOL. Lost that money and even hired a crypto attorney to see if they could recover my funds. Apparently once it went into that coin or wallet by my own doing and accident, There was no recovering them. \n\nAgain that's not part of this discussion but the complexity of some trading could result is large losses. The average retiree won't be willing to put 1/3 or 1/2 their retirement into a coin or system that they will need training and help setting up a wallet to store their funds. My long winded post comes to the question. What can or will have to happen for btc to become mainstream enough the average or novice investor feels safe enough to be able to buy in and place part of their retirement in crypto. \n\n\nSetting up phrases then passworkd phrases to get in your trezor that can't be stored online for fear of hacking will scare your average investor. You reading this think this is foreign thinking because you have a basic or even advance understanding of crypto buying, sending and storing. Even now as I am setting up a tree safe 5, I am a little concerned about what I can do online in regards to being connected to the internet and what can and can't be hacked. So I store my words for my acct and trezor in a safe. How do you safely store your words and info in the case you pass away and need to transfer your assets to your kids. I don't think you want to store the words or passwords to your accts in your trust or will, people have access to that. I know there are stampings and metal plates you can store your passwords on but who and where do you trust to keep those. \n\nYour average 60-80 year old who is retired or close to retiring won't feel safe putting 6-7 figures in a system that is this complex to learn for a novice. I buy stocks , I pass away, my kids inherit my accts and they can keep or liquidate the stocks for liquid. I pass away and give them a cold storage wallet with the passwords and how to access the btc, that's a burden they now have to learn. Will crypto always be so complicated for those who don't spend time learning all the ins-outs of security. Buying Microsoft or Apple stock is simple enough. \n\nI can go to cashapp and buy stocks . I've been investing in stocks and various assets for 35 years, I've never been so worried about am I doing this and that right not to lose or have my btc hacked. Will the system ever become easy and mainstream enough that a lot of this fear is removed. I know debit cards are stolen and checking accts hacked, money moved. But your average person isn't near as worried about that as they are losing their crypto. I read between 6-17% of adults own crypto, that number needs to skyrocket to become mainstream. \n\nLook at the prices now, think of 50-60-80% of adults who own crypto, what that would do to the price. For crypto to become a mainstream form of currency. A lot of this fear and difficulty needs to be removed. Some of you reading this since you understand this will think this post is over the top. I assure you if you ask 50 people most of them have 2 concerns. How to buy and send and how to store it safely. Until that fear eases. Will crypto ever reach the price predictions some say if the average person can't buy, trade and store crypto without these worries. Again I own crypto. Will buy crypto, will store it to pass to my kids one day. But I feel the complexity of how to do this reamains one of the sticking points to what needs to become easier so the price reaches insane highs while removing the doubt of will I lose my crypto. \n\nAny thoughts if or how crypto becomes easier for the average Joe or retiree to buy and store becomes easier. Sorry for the long winded post but I hope you get the jist of the post.\n\nEdit to post****+\nJust to add to the complexity. I just ordered a tezor safe 5 and I had to cancel the order. I don't own a computer, only an iPhone and iPad. I trade 7 figures worth of stocks and options a week off an iPad but can't run a cold wallet from an iPad. This has to become easier and more mainstream . I can log in my bank acct with my iPad. Transfer or wire 6 figures to my investing acct. trade stocks. Sell stocks, wire the money back to my bank acct. buy bitcoin on cashapp and coinbase on my iPad but not use it for cold storage. Head scratching. ",

        "selftext": "[\\[source wikipedia\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Personal_life)\n\n# Engagement\n\nIn 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague [Joan Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Clarke), a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly \"unfazed\" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.[^(\\[162\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-163)\n\n# Homosexuality and indecency conviction\n\nIn December 1951, Turing met Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing was walking along Manchester's [Oxford Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmslow_Road) when he met Murray just outside the [Regal Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehouse) and invited him to lunch. The two agreed to meet again and in January 1952 began an intimate relationship.[^(\\[163\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-164) On 23 January, Turing's house in Wilmslow was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[^(\\[164\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-165) and both men were charged with \"[gross indecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_indecency)\" under [Section 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885#Section_11) of the [Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885).[^(\\[165\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-LeavittP268-166) Initial [committal proceedings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committal_procedure) for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor \"reserved his defence\", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. The proceedings were held at the [Sessions House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sessions_House,_Knutsford) in [Knutsford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knutsford).[^(\\[166\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-167)\n\nTuring was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.[^(\\[167\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-168) The case, [*Regina*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) *v. Turing and Murray,* was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[^(\\[168\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-169) Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo [hormonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone) physical changes designed to reduce [libido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido), known as \"[chemical castration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration)\".[^(\\[169\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-:2-170) He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as [diethylstilbestrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol) or DES), a synthetic [oestrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oestrogen); this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing [impotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impotence) and caused [breast tissue to form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecomastia).[^(\\[170\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-171) In a letter, Turing wrote that \"no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out\".[^(\\[171\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-172)[^(\\[172\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-173) Murray was given a conditional discharge.[^(\\[173\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-174)\n\nTuring's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the [Government Communications Headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters) (GCHQ), the British [signals intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_intelligence) agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic post. His trial took place only months after the defection to the Soviet Union of [Guy Burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Burgess) and [Donald Maclean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Maclean_(spy)), in summer 1951, after which the Foreign Office started to consider anyone known to be homosexual as a potential security risk.[^(\\[174\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-175)\n\nTuring was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries.[^(\\[175\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-176) In the summer of 1952 he visited Norway which was more tolerant of homosexuals. Among the various men he met there was one named Kjell Carlson. Kjell intended to visit Turing in the UK but the authorities intercepted Kjell's postcard detailing his travel arrangements and were able to intercept and deport him before the two could meet.[^(\\[176\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-olinick13-177) It was also during this time that Turing started consulting a psychiatrist, Dr Franz Greenbaum, with whom he got on well and who subsequently became a family friend.[^(\\[176\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-olinick13-177)[^(\\[177\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-dowd-178)\n\n# Death\n\nOn 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, [Wilmslow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmslow), Turing's housekeeper found him dead.[^(\\[178\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-copperfolly-179) A post mortem was held that evening, which determined that he had died the previous day at age 41 with [cyanide poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning) cited as the cause of death.[^(\\[179\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-180)[^(\\[180\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-181) When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[^(\\[181\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-182) it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose.\n\n# ",

        "selftext": "Just five years ago, the idea of cooperation between crypto exchanges and traditional banks seemed far. One represented decentralization the other, stability and institutional structure. But times have changed and quickly. Today, banks that ignore the integration of crypto functionality aren’t just missing out on innovation - they’re risking becoming irrelevant and outdated.\n\nAs digital finance accelerates, crypto is no longer just a curiosity. It’s becoming infrastructure. And for traditional banks, working with crypto exchanges is turning from an idea into a strategic necessity.\n\nMost of the crypto exchanges are already in close collaboration with neobanks:\n\n**Kraken partnered with Bunq** \\- [https://thefintechtimes.com/bunq-partners-with-kraken-to-launch-in-app-crypto-investment-capabilities/](https://thefintechtimes.com/bunq-partners-with-kraken-to-launch-in-app-crypto-investment-capabilities/)\n\n**Bybit with MasterCard** \\- [https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/92c35-mastercard-teams-up-with-bybit-to-introduce-new-crypto-powered-debit-card](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/92c35-mastercard-teams-up-with-bybit-to-introduce-new-crypto-powered-debit-card)\n\n**WhiteBIT collaborated with Misyon** \\- [https://crypto.news/whitebit-tr-partners-with-misyon-bank-amid-turkeys-rapidly-changing-crypto-landscape/](https://crypto.news/whitebit-tr-partners-with-misyon-bank-amid-turkeys-rapidly-changing-crypto-landscape/)\n\nAnd many others have joined the trend recently or a long time ago already.\n\n**Banks and Crypto Aren’t Enemies. They’re Becoming Partners**\n\nWith trillions in market capitalization and growing adoption among both retail and institutional investors, it’s clear that crypto is here to stay. Customers want to manage their finance and crypto assets in the same place. They expect flexibility, transparency, and 24/7 accessibility: features that traditional banking has long promised, but not always delivered.  \nThat’s where crypto exchange integration comes in. Rather than building blockchain infrastructure from scratch, banks are increasingly partnering with exchanges to embed crypto services into their offerings.\n\n# Why does it matter strategically for banks?\n\nRetaining the Next Generation of Customers. Millennials and Gen Z are growing up with crypto as part of their financial reality. If banks don’t offer these services, they’ll lose customers to others that do.  \nCompetition with the giants. Tech giants like Apple, PayPal, and Revolut are already integrating crypto features. To stay relevant, banks need to do more than just keep up.\n\nNew revenue opportunities. Integrating digital assets can unlock new revenue opportunities for banks.  \nPositioning as Innovation Leaders. Offering crypto functionality isn’t just about technology. It tells customers and the market: we’re evolving, we’re relevant and we’re here for the long term.\n\n\\**Forward-thinking banks are no longer building walls. They’re building bridges. \\**\n\nCrypto exchanges are proving to be some of the most valuable partners in that construction process. By integrating with crypto exchanges, traditional banks can transform themselves. More agile. More responsive. More aligned with what modern finance actually looks like.\n\n***The question is no longer whether banks will engage with crypto. The real question is: will they lead, or will they follow?***\n\n  \nC - Christopher Wells",

        "title": "RizzFi: Injecting Culture and Confidence into DeFi",
        "selftext": "In the vast landscape of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), most conversations revolve around technology, market trends, and protocol security. It's a space filled with innovation, but also heavy jargon, sterile branding, and an overload of charts. While these elements are essential for understanding and navigating the crypto world, they rarely speak to the identity and culture of the people building and participating in these ecosystems.\n\nThat’s where a concept like RizzFi comes in — a project, or better said, a movement, that explores the fusion of financial intelligence with cultural resonance and personal branding. But before we dig deeper into what RizzFi represents, let’s take a step back and talk about what’s missing in DeFi right now.\n\nWhere's the Culture in Crypto?\n\nDeFi is revolutionary. It has democratized access to financial tools that were once reserved for institutions and the privileged few. It offers lending, staking, trading, and yield farming, all without needing a middleman. But for all its disruption, DeFi often feels like a cold and technical environment. Terms like “liquidity pools,” “slippage,” and “impermanent loss” dominate the conversation, while the human element — the why behind participation — often gets lost.\n\nWe talk a lot about what DeFi does, but rarely about how it makes people feel or who it represents.\n\nThis is where culture comes into play. In traditional finance, branding and public perception matter greatly. Think of names like Robinhood, Revolut, or Cash App — they succeed not just because of functionality, but because they connect emotionally with their users.\n\nCrypto has room to do the same. In fact, as Web3 becomes more mainstream, cultural identity, design, and storytelling will matter more than ever.\n\nEnter RizzFi: Confidence Meets Crypto\n\nThe name \"RizzFi\" may sound like a meme at first glance. “Rizz” is a slang term, often associated with charisma, charm, and social finesse — the ability to stand out and carry confidence. But don’t let that fool you. RizzFi is an idea that taps into something deeper.\n\nIt asks: What if we approached finance not just as a utility, but as a reflection of personal and cultural expression?\n\nRizzFi doesn’t propose a radically new DeFi protocol (at least not yet), but rather a new attitude around participation. It’s about making smart financial moves, but doing it with swagger. It’s about combining functionality with personality. In a world where most crypto platforms feel clinical and feature-heavy, RizzFi imagines an experience where users feel empowered — where using DeFi tools isn’t just practical, but aspirational.\n\nThis approach doesn’t mean ignoring security, transparency, or performance. It means designing with the user in mind — not just for usability, but for identity.\n\nSmart Money with Style\n\nWhat would it look like if DeFi apps had better UX?\nWhat if onboarding into a staking platform felt like joining an exclusive club?\nWhat if wallets didn’t just store assets but told your crypto story?\nThese are the kinds of ideas RizzFi encourages.\n\nImagine:\n\nA dashboard that doesn't just show your portfolio, but celebrates milestones.\n\nA staking pool that feels like joining a social circle.\n\nLeaderboards not for whales, but for wallet diversity and creative DeFi strategies.\n\nBadges that represent your “crypto journey” visually.\n\n\nAll of these are ways to gamify and humanize crypto — and it’s something Gen Z and younger millennials are already seeking.\n\nWhy Style Matters in Finance\n\nIt may seem strange to talk about “style” in something as serious as finance, but perception plays a powerful role in adoption. Look at how brands like Tesla, Apple, and Nike built empires not only on product performance, but cultural influence.\n\nIn the same way, crypto projects that balance substance with story, and data with design, are more likely to connect with a wider audience.\n\n[RizzFi](https://rizzFi.com), in that sense, isn’t trying to be everything to everyone. It’s for the crypto user who wants more than yield — they want experience, expression, and maybe a little flex along the way.\n\nIt’s a subtle reminder that how we interact with financial tools is just as important as what those tools do.\n\nNot Just Hype — A Call for Innovation\n\nOf course, the crypto community is right to be cautious. There are far too many meme coins, rug pulls, and hype-driven projects that lack real value. But RizzFi isn’t about empty marketing. It’s about raising the bar for how DeFi can feel, without sacrificing what makes it powerful in the first place.\n\nDesign, branding, and user experience should not be afterthoughts. They should be built into the foundation. Because let’s be honest — most DeFi platforms still look like spreadsheets from 2002.\n\nIf we want broader adoption, especially from younger, more design-savvy users, we need more projects that understand aesthetics and identity matter. RizzFi is a playful but powerful reminder that crypto can be cool, inclusive, and engaging — without compromising on decentralization or trustlessness.\n\nFinal Thoughts: DeFi with Drip\n\nSo, does crypto need rizz?\n\nMaybe not in the literal sense. But it does need personality. It needs better design. It needs experiences that users want to come back to. That’s what RizzFi represents — not just a product or protocol, but an idea. A direction where crypto is more than a tool — it’s a lifestyle.\n\nAnd maybe that’s how we get from niche to mainstream.\nNot just by solving technical problems, but by creating emotional connections.\nNot just by optimizing yield, but by maximizing meaning.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, people don’t just adopt tools — they adopt ideas.\n\nWelcome to RizzFi.\nFinance with flavor. Confidence in code.\nAnd yeah — we’ve got rizz.",

        "selftext": "At least 1.6M stolen from a wallet drainer in Apple's App Store - Cointelegraph reports! \n\nYesterday Cointelegraph doxxed a Web3 hacker for his role in the fake Rabby\\_IO Wallets that made it into the app store before the real one earlier this year.\n\nKonstantin Pylinskiy aka konpyl, CEO of Moonward Capital, is the person held responsible according to the Cointelegraph article. \n\nThis is the first instance I can recall of a major media company doxxing a hacker with a very detailed analysis of the theft!\n\nThe widely reported scam took place on Feb 16th 2024, but I'm showing based on victim reports it happened first on Dec 23rd 2023 and possibly as early as Oct 2023.\n\n[A twitter post from a user scammed by the fake Rabby Wallet on Dec 23rd 2023](https://preview.redd.it/b8ln123lvcvd1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0623fc8bad39c0036eb100f7733d9b81feac4db)\n\nI came across a few Support threads related to the fake Rabby wallets uploaded, one being here on Reddit, the other on a forum on Apple's own website.\n\nAdditionally, when the hack initially happened, most Media outlets reported the theft in the mid six figures. \n\nThe article by Cointelegraph mentions the amount at over 1.6 MILLION lost. A full accounting is needed to get the true number.\n\n# How the Fake Rabby Wallet Scam Happened\n\nTo get past Apple's strict review process with a wallet drainer not once, but at least twice, maybe even three times is quite the feat! If one of the most secure and trusted companies around can get scammed multiple time, no one is safe in web3!\n\nThe prevailing theory is the malicious developer of the fake Rabby Wallet applied to the iOS App Store under some generic fintech name. The app itself would appear innocent enough to the reviewer. \n\nOnce the app was approved, the developer was able to change the name to \"Rabby Wallet & Crypto Solution\" while inserting malicious code to turn that innocent little financial app into a vicious crypto drainer.\n\nWhen DeBank announced the launch of the real Rabby Wallet in the app store, the fake Rabby Wallet was already live while the real Rabby Wallet was still in Apple's approval process.\n\nThe accused bad actor, \"konpyl\", was able to drain numerous unsuspecting victims who thought they were engaging with the real Rabby Wallet, but instead got a fake one that targeted their crypto assets.\n\n# Tracing the Funds\n\n[Tracing the funds mentioned in the Cointelegraph article between 0x4E9395cc1075b57016BF8b5bF8782BFEF94c71C2 \\(left image\\) and 0x44BdB19dB1Cd29D546597AF7dc0549e7f6F9E480 \\(right image\\). ](https://preview.redd.it/h14ljc1c6dvd1.png?width=2756&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac8f20103059331d50ed35c0b6fa9264180608ae)\n\nThe flow of funds from the article can be extremely difficult to follow along at home but I'll do my best! A more detailed post about all of the wallets mentioned would make for a very lengthy analysis.\n\nThe research does look pretty spot on. The main connection I see to \"konpyl\" is that wallet with his former Opensea username - 0x44BdB19dB1Cd29D546597AF7dc0549e7f6F9E480 and the Rhinofi output wallet of 0x4E9395cc1075b57016BF8b5bF8782BFEF94c71C2 mentioned in the article.\n\nI counted 6 txns worth almost 100k and found some shared deposit address activity between the two wallets as well.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to get a true number of the total amount lost in the scam and wallets involved without a detailed analysis of the theft dates. 1.6M lost could be a conservative number and the total victim account could be much higher. \n\n# Apple's Role in the Theft\n\nIt's wild to think malicious web3 applications can consistently make it into Apple's App Store. Traditionally, Apple has had a \"hands off\" approach when it comes to these things.\n\nThe Cointelegraph article mentions Google's approach, which appears to put in some effort to stop bad actors by publicity going after individuals who abuse Google Play.\n\nI do think Apple has an obligation to protect users from any and all threats that appear in the App store.\n\nAlso due to the public nature of this theft, I'm hopeful for some recovery for some of the victims!\n\n",
