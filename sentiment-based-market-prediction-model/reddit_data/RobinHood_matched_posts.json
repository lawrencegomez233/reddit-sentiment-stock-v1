But question….most successful continues like Apple, Walmart, Microsoft are priced mostly under 500 a share on the stock market. Now say if that stock rose up to 1k or maybe even 2k would it be delisted or would ppl like Robinhood and other investing apps keep the stock share up there expecting people to still buy shares or what happens if the stock gets too expensive?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSorry to ask such a basic question here. I understand that Robinhood in the UK does 24 hour market trading (Sunday 8 PM ET through Friday 8 PM ET). \n\nI have just put a 'Limit Buy' order in for 100 Apple Shares at $196.99 (it is currently Saturday). The order says 'queued' and there is a message on the order which reads '*This order will be processed when markets open on Monday 01:00*'\n\nMonday 01:00 UK would be Sunday 8pm ET. \n\nAm I correct in thinking that at 1am on Monday I will be assigned 100 shares at $196.99 before markets open? \n\nThe reason I want to get the Apple shares before opening is because I feel they will jump when markets open on Monday, so I am trying to get in early so to speak.  I have never done out of hours trading so any feedback here would be much appreciated. Thank you. ",
