        "selftext": "Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.\n\nIn early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.\n\n I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.\n\n Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  \n\nThese were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. \n\nI sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. \n\nAnd…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.\n\nEvery year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.\n\nEvery time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.\n\n•\t2-for-1 split in 2000  \n•\t2-for-1 split in 2005  \n•\t7-for-1 split in 2014  \n•\t4-for-1 split in 2020\n\nNowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.\n\nThe security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.\n\nI do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  \n\nI do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",

        "selftext": "Apple’s overall revenue rose by 4% in the first quarter, but it missed on Wall Street’s iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported on Thursday. \n\nHere’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 28. \n\nEarnings per share: $2.40 vs. $2.35 estimated \n\nRevenue: $124.30 billion vs. $124.12 billion estimated \n\n iPhone revenue: $69.14 billion vs. $71.03 billion estimated \n\nMac revenue: $8.99 billion vs. $7.96 billion estimated \n\niPad revenue: $8.09 billion vs. $7.32 billion estimated \n\nOther Products revenue: $11.75 billion vs. $12.01 billion estimated \n\nServices revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated \n\nGross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated \n\n Although Apple’s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company’s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  \n\nApple’s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. \n\nThe company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It’s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. \n\nApple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn’t accessible in China or in Chinese. \n\n“During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,” Cook said.  \n\nCook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company’s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in “channel inventory,” the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  \n\n“If you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,” Cook said. \n\nApple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. \n\nThe company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. \n\nApple’s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year’s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. \n\nThe company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  \n\n“It’s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,” Cook said.  \n\nApple’s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store system.  \n\nThe company’s “other products” category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. \n\nApple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.   \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/apple-aapl-q1-earnings-2025.html",

While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  \n\n“On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that’s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.  \n\nCook said that while Apple doesn’t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  \n\n“What we’ve done is we’ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,” Cook said. “From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners’ financials, and we would be paying expense.” \n\n“Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we’re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,” Cook continued.  \n\nApple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. \n\nCook said that about half of iPad buyers haven’t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. \n\nApple’s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  \n\nApple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under “Wearables, Home, and Accessories.” Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  \n\n“A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we’re still growing that base significantly,” Cook said.  \n\nThe Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company’s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple’s forecast and LSEG estimates. \n\nApple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple’s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  \n\nApple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple’s App Store.  \n\nHowever, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  \n\n“Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,” Cook said. “Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.” \n\nApple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q3-2024.html",

China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.\n\n\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.\n\nAs trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.\n\n\"The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,\" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate \"this new world of tariffs.\"\n\nUntil then, he warned, \"tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.\"\n\nOther Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.\n\nIn afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.\n\nOutside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.\n\n\"The implications \\[of the announced tariffs\\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \\[chip\\] sector,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. \"These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.\"\n\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.\n\nHe added, \"The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.\"",

The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.\n\n\"Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,\" Buffett wrote.\n\n'FISCAL FOLLY'\n\nThis year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.\n\n\"Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,\" Buffett said.\n\nBuffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.\n\nHe said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,\nBut he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism \"has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,\" with malfeasance by \"scoundrels and promoters\" in full force.\n\nHe urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying \"fiscal folly\" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times \"come close to the edge.\"\n\nBuffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the \"American miracle,\" has depended on people's ability to participate.\n\nThat, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.\n\n\"Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,\" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.\n\"And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,\" he added.\n\nCathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire \"hold,\" said: \"Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.\"\n\nFEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWhile Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.\n\nOther stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.\n\nBerkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.\nThe company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.\n\nOver the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.\n\n\"They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,\" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.\n\nTens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.\n\nBuffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been \"eliminated or greatly minimized.\"\n\nThe meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.\nIn discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.\n\n\"We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,\" he said. \"In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.\"\n\n",

I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.\n\nThen I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.\n\nIt doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.\n\nHowever, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.\n\nLastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful\n\n[AAPL business segment revenue 2024 Q1-Q4](https://preview.redd.it/chcmjkylhj6e1.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbbca8158c8b697ff8f97ccc847321d052c49118)\n\nAll in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.\n\nPosition: long \\~$21,000 in shares",

        "selftext": "Apple reported second fiscal-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company’s closely-watched Services division came up light versus estimates.  \n\nHere’s how Apple did versus consensus estimates for the quarter ending in March: \n\n* EPS $1.65 vs. $1.63 estimated by LSEG \n\n* Revenue: $95.4 billion vs. $94.66 billion estimated by LSEG \n\n* iPhone revenue: $46.84 billion vs. $45.84 billion estimated, per StreetAccount \n\n* Mac revenue: $7.95 billion vs. $7.77 billion estimated, per StreetAccount  \n\n* iPad revenue: $6.4 billion vs. $6.20 billion estimated, per StreetAccount \n\n* Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $7.52 billion vs. $7.95 billion, per StreetAccount \n\n* Services revenue: $26.65 billion vs. $26.70 billion, per StreetAccount \n\n* Gross margin: 41.7% vs. 47.1%, per StreetAccount \n\nThe company reported $1.65 per share on $24.78 billion of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period. \n\nApple typically provides data points about how it sees the current quarter shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is highly anticipating CEO Tim Cook’s first public comments on how Apple will navigate rapidly-shifting tariffs proposed by the Trump administration. \n\nAnalysts are looking for third-quarter guidance of $1.48 in earnings per share on $89.45 billion of sales. \n\nCook told CNBC that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than they are from China. Apple still makes the “vast majority” of its products for other countries from China, Cook said.  \n\n“If you look at the U.S., over half of the U.S. sales of iPhone come from India,” Cook said. “If you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.” \n\nCook said the iPhone uses a lot of chips made domestically, and that Apple is buying 19 billion chips this year from the U.S.  \n\n“With an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,” he said.  \n\nApple said its board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases this quarter, down from $110 billion in authorization last year. Apple also said it would pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, a 4% increase. \n\n“We continue to plan for annual dividend increases,” Cook said.  \n\nThe company’s most important product line, iPhones, topped estimates at $46.8 billion in sales during the quarter. The overall product line’s sales were up just under 2% on an annual basis.  \n\nApple’s profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google.  \n\nCook, in a statement, hailed “double-digit” Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple’s services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter.  \n\nApple hardware generally did well during the quarter. \n\nMac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March.  \n\nHowever, Apple’s wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. \n\nSales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates.  \n\nOn the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple’s largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order “pull forward” because of tariffs.  \n\n“We don’t believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,” Cook said. “There’s no obvious evidence of it.” \n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2025-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2025-.html)",

        "selftext": "Apple is the world’s most valuable company, the most beloved consumer brand, and the best-run capital return machine in the modern stock market. It has survived every bear thesis, adapted to every challenge, and delivered shareholders a relentless stream of buybacks, dividends, and steady earnings growth.\n\nAt 33x forward earnings, the market is pricing Apple as if it will continue this dominance indefinitely. But no company can defy gravity forever. Apple’s next phase of growth depends on emerging markets, where its traditional advantages—brand strength, pricing power, and ecosystem lock-in—are not guaranteed to work the same way they have in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMuch like a perfectly applied face of makeup, Apple looks flawless at first glance. But take a closer look, and a few cracks start to appear. Buybacks are masking slowing earnings growth. Services margins, long assumed to be unassailable, are under regulatory threat. And in markets where Apple is banking on its next wave of users, it’s facing competition from companies that know these regions better and are playing an entirely different game.\n\nThe market assumes Apple will extend its dominance effortlessly. The data suggests otherwise.\n\n# The Market Assumes the iPhone Will Conquer Everywhere. That’s a Risky Bet.\n\nIn North America, Apple’s pricing power is sacred. In emerging markets, it is anything but.\n\nApple’s dominance in the U.S. is built on two things: a premium brand and a seamless ecosystem. People don’t leave iOS because switching out of iMessage, AirDrop, and the App Store is a hassle. But in places like India, Latin America, and Africa, the default phone isn’t an iPhone. It’s an Android device, often made by Xiaomi, OPPO, or Transsion, where users have already built their own ecosystems of digital services.\n\nThat’s a problem for Apple’s long-term growth. If users in these markets don’t start on iOS, they aren’t going to be locked into Apple’s ecosystem later. And in the places where Apple is growing, it’s often doing so by selling older iPhones at discounted prices—an approach that works for market share but erodes the premium pricing model that has sustained its margins.\n\nApple is winning some battles, but at what cost?\n\n* **Latin America**: iPhone shipments jumped 21% year-over-year in 2024, but most of that growth came from discounted older models and local assembly in Brazil to avoid import tariffs. The broader smartphone market in the region grew 10% in the same period. That means Apple isn’t necessarily taking over—it’s just keeping up by cutting prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi continues to outsell Apple, offering comparable hardware at a fraction of the price.\n* **India**: Apple is making its biggest push yet, opening flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi, ramping up local manufacturing, and introducing aggressive financing options. Morgan Stanley estimates India will account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth over the next five years. But the market reality is stark: iOS has less than 11% market share, and the vast majority of smartphones sold in India cost under $300. Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.\n* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.\n* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.\n\nThe big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.\n\n# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.\n\nApple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.\n\nBut Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.\n\n* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.\n* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.\n* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.\n\nThe App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.\n\nInvestors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.\n\n# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.\n\nApple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.\n\n* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.\n* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.\n* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.\n\n# When Does Apple Become a Buy?\n\nApple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:\n\n* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.\n* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.\n* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.\n\nApple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price? I don't think it is.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI’m new to equity analysis and have put together the above deep dive on Apple’s valuation, particularly its challenges in emerging markets and risks to services growth. Please let me know what you think about Apple's share price and future.\n\nI work on these memos for my own personal investments. I hold Apple indirectly through VGT.\n\n**TLDR:** My analysis indicates Apple is a weaker equity than people might think —Apple’s future growth relies on price-sensitive markets where it lacks its usual pricing power, while services, its high-margin growth driver, faces regulatory threats. Without a new major revenue stream, growth looks constrained. Management has a strong track record of launching successful businesses, but at 33x forward earnings believing they’ll pull something new out of the hat requires a leap of faith.",

        "selftext": "Apple’s big developer conference kicks off June 9, and Wall Street is *watching closely* — especially with the AI hype still going strong.\n\nLast year, Apple teased us with “Apple Intelligence,” their own take on generative AI. Big demos, big promises... but not much follow-through. Siri still isn’t GPT-level, and most of the AI features we *did* get have been kind of meh.\n\nSo what should we expect this year?\n\nHere’s a quick rundown:\n\n iOS/macOS/iPadOS are getting a major design overhaul, reportedly inspired by the Vision Pro’s visionOS. Mark Gurman says it’s the biggest visual revamp since iOS 7.\n\n AI features in smaller doses  like an intelligent battery manager that learns your habits, and live translation for AirPods (finally catching up to Google). But don’t expect ChatGPT-style magic just yet.\n\n Apple might open its own LLMs to devs, allowing on-device AI apps. That could be a big deal long-term if devs jump in.\n\n New unified gaming app  looks like Apple wants to get serious about gaming. Still miles away from console-level stuff, but their App Store is already a mobile gaming monster.\n\nAlso, the iPhone 17 is rumored to be thinner and lighter**,** and paired with the new OS could help reignite sales in China  where Apple’s been struggling for a few quarters now.\n\nBottom line: Apple might not blow minds like last year, but if the software updates are slick enough and the AI stuff feels *usable*, it could be enough to get AAPL back in the good graces of investors.",

        "selftext": "**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. \n\n>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\n>\n\n>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.\n\n>\n\n>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\n>\n\n>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.\n\n>\n\n>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\n>\n\n>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>\n\n>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”\n\n>\n\n>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\n>\n\n>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\n>\n\n>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.\n\n>\n\n>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\n>\n\n>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.\n\n>\n\n>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/apple-and-spacex-link-up-to-support-starlink-satellite-network-on-iphones](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/apple-and-spacex-link-up-to-support-starlink-satellite-network-on-iphones)",

Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak.

Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup.

MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings.

Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas\n3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  \nPotential Risks  \n1.

High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions.

Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.\nIn the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.\n",

From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.\nFundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or \"still a bull market\" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)\n\nSome concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. \n\nSo yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming \"anti USA\" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.\n\nThis is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. \n\nHere's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.\n\n\n\nThere's a school of thought that says \"markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable\" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will \"always\" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.\nAnother consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now. ",

        "title": "Trump, Chip Maker TSMC Expected to Announce $100 Billion Investment in U.S.",
        "selftext": "WASHINGTON—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330 -1.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle intends to invest $100 billion in chip-manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years under a plan expected to be announced later Monday by President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe investment would be used to build out cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.\n\nTSMC, the world’s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company’s first factory began mass production late last year.\n\nTSMC’s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.\n\nSince the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC’s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer—key factors for AI applications.\n\n[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.\n\n“We’re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,” TSMC said in a statement.\n\nU.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.—although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs. Last month, he said he was considering a 25% or more tariff on semiconductor imports.\n\n“We have to have chips made in this country. Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything—almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made—we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect,” Trump said in February.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has appeared at the White House with the chief executives of several companies to announce pledges to invest in the U.S. The details of the projects are often vague and it is often unclear whether the pledges represent [new investments by the companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-corporate-new-job-investment-what-to-expect-ad19993c?mod=article_inline).\n\nOpenAI’s Sam Altman, database company [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL) and investment giant [SoftBank Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JP/XTKS/9984) pledged to invest as much as $500 billion into building artificial-intelligence infrastructure in the U.S., though Trump adviser [Elon Musk](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/elon-musk) has questioned whether the project would come to fruition.\n\nLast week, [Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL) said it plans to [spend more than $500 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-500-billion-investment-us-19ca11a0?mod=article_inline) over the next four years to expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-chip-maker-tsmc-expected-to-announce-100-billion-investment-in-u-s-02a44399?mod=hp_lead_pos6",

        "title": "Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone",
        "selftext": "President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.\n\nBut there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.\n\nBacking off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was \"significant\" and \"very justified,\" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.\n\nIt \"may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,\" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.\n\nThe stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.\n\nThe final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for \"general search\" and \"general search text.”\n\nNo matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.\n\nFinal remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.\n\nIt didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.\n\n\"Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,\" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.\n\nIt argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”\n\nThey also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.\n\nBut prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.\n\nAnthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.\n\nDerek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.\n\n\"They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.\"\n\nThe tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.\n\n\"What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.\n\n\"It seems ill-timed to do that.\"\n\nThe DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.\n\nIt asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.\n\nThat is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.\n\nBernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.\n\nGoogle countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.\n\nMcCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.\n\n\"Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,\" McCareins said.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-doj-wants-a-google-breakup-but-is-willing-to-leave-ai-alone-080016759.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACYwia9l044SxGCK_mri0gx-4TVLrnZzE1cLyqspOVq-n2zGEeY521rJZBcbAtAtZpG9pjQwjgHdoWCYutDGYaydayerBR3eZ7CxOK4KvoFb-5qR8PHIRJROnWQ40ALMQ9_HnlhH1NvgeQDycPTYmotjrq1CJK9_Z0lsxa8n3nyq",

That highlighted the way the Trump administration’s tariffs campaign — peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods — is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.\n\nInvestors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.’s artificial intelligence chips.\n\nLast year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.\n\nThe value of phone component exports to India — home to Apple’s biggest iPhone production base outside of China — roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.\n\nApple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home. The device has never been produced in the US, a project that appears unfeasible at least in the short run.",

These products were initially subject to tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, in addition to a general 10% global tariff.\n\nThe official reason cited was to avoid passing excessive costs onto U.S. consumers and to reduce pressure on major American tech firms—particularly those heavily reliant on Asian manufacturing, like Apple and Nvidia.\n\nWhile markets reacted positively late on Friday, with a modest rebound in tech stocks, the bigger question is: what happens next?\n\t•\tCould this lead to a broader tech-led recovery in the coming days?\n\t•\tOr will uncertainty around future sector-specific tariffs (as hinted by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick) limit any upside?\n\t•\tWhat are the likely short-term impacts on supply chains and investor sentiment?\n\nSome sectors to watch might include semiconductors, consumer electronics, and companies with significant China exposure.\n\nDo you think this is just a temporary boost or the start of a more sustained rally?

Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.\n\nTesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.\n\nBut it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.\n\nShort sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.\n\nThe crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.\n\nNow, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.\n\n\"Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. \"But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market.

Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.\n\nInvestors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.\n\nMega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today.

        "title": "[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint",
        "selftext": "Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.\n\nThe tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.\n\nReuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.\n\n\"Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,\" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. \"There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.\"\n\nA Broadcom spokesperson said the company is \"evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.\"\n\nIntel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.\n\nBroadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.\n\nSome of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.\n\n**CRUCIAL SETBACK**\n\nAs part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.\n\nIntel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.\n\nIntel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.\n\nTypically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.\n\nBroadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.\n\nFor an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.\n\nTSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.\n\nMoving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.\n\nBetting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.\n\nIntel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.\n\nThe company plans to be \"manufacturing-ready\" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers \"actively engaged\" with the tool kit.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-manufacturing-business-suffers-setback-broadcom-tests-disappoint-sources-2024-09-04/",

        "selftext": "Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. \n\nThe ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.\n\nAccording to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.\n\nBelow is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..\n\n|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|1933.5|10.91||\n|1940|12.05|10.44%|\n|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|\n|1953|26.38|43.13%|\n|1959.5|58.68|122%|\n|1966|92.88|58%|\n|1972.5|107.14|15%|\n|1979|99.93|-7.22%|\n|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|\n|1992|408.78|113%|\n|1998.5|1133.84|177%|\n|2005|1181.27|4.10%|\n|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|\n|2018|2471.65|87.10%|\n|2024.5|5525.29|123%|\n\nWhile the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.\n\nHistorically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.\n\nCurrently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.\n\nIn the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...\n\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).\n* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).\n\nImages aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07\n\nHistorically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.\n\n* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.\n* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.\n* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).\n\n**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**\n\nOutside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.\n\n* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.\n* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.\n* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.\n* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.\n* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.\n* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.\n* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.\n* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).\n* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.\n* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.\n* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.\n* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.\n* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.\n* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.\n* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.\n\nI believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.\n\n**This economic downturn may be severe.**\n\nIn the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.\n\n**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**\n\nPeople have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.\n\nThis will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.\n\n**What happens from here?**\n\nI don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.\n\nThe prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. \n\n**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**\n\nMy positions: \n\nBought 50 $570 10/2 puts at open this morning right at open.

Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.\n\nA U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.\n\nAfter markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.\n\n# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report\n\nWednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.\n\nTrump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.\n\n# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market\n\nGameStop’s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which fired up the meme stock craze in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies centering their business models on buying bitcoin.\n\nAI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle’s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SoftBank as part of a joint venture known as Stargate to build AI infrastructure. Adobe’s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the company’s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.\n\n# This Week’s Calendar\n\n**Monday, June 9**\n\n* Wholesale inventories (April)\n* Apple’s (AAPL) WWDC conference begins with CEO Tim Cook's keynote address and special event\n* Key Earnings: Casey’s General Stores (CASY)\n\n**Tuesday, June 10**\n\n* NFIB Small Business Optimism Index (May)\n* Key Earnings: GameStop, J.M.

The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.\n\nThe agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.\n\nTSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.\n\nTwo of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHowever, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.\n\nAll of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.\n\n*source: Yahoo!

Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.\n\nContext: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.\n\nRisks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.\n\nRelated Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL\n\nOffhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)\n\nTicker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.\n\nIt leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.\n\nKerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.\n\nThe report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.\n\nContext: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.\n\nSector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.\n\nKerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.\n\nChina's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.\n\nRisks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.\n\nRelated Tickers: LRCX, AMAT, KLAC\n\nTicker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.\n\nContext: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.\n\nIntel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.\n\nRisks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.\n\nRelated Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM\n\nTicker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.\n\nContext: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.\n\nSector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.\n\nRisks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.\n\nRelated Tickers: T/VZ/RKLB",

        "selftext": "I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.\n\nSince late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.\n\nIt's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.\n\nPrevious generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.\n\nWith recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).\n\nThese observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.\n\nThe fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.\n\nCost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\n**Stay agile, and be on the lookout for tariff news from Beijing.**\n\nNews: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.\n\n[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.\n\n[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the \"worst housing market in almost 50 years.\" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.\n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to \"Liberation Day\" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.\n\n[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan. The White House clarified that semis are exempt from these tariffs, which provides a buffer for NVIDIA's core business and limits downside risk from the new trade measures. We still saw a 6% move post-tariff announcement.",

Raised full-year product revenue guidance to $4.33B vs. $4.29B exp. Q2 product revenue guidance of $1.035B–$1.045B implies \\~25% growth (from a random SA article I read). Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\-OpenAI announced the acquisition of Jony Ive's AI hardware startup for $6.4B. This is the first shot in what I consider the \"AI Consumer Hardware War\" (sorry Humane Pin, you don't count lol). This positions OpenAI to develop a new generation of AI-powered devices and could challenge Apple in the AI space. Stock fell intraday yesterday 2-3%, interested to see if we continue that selloff. Watching the 200 level as well. Apple has essentially fallen flat with AI (Apple Intelligence) and hasn't struck gold recently with any good hardware, we can safely consider the Apple Vision a bust.\n\n[**FICO (FICO)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FICO&p=d)\\-FHFA director William J. Pulte called for the provider of credit scores to be more \"economical\" and that FHFA is considering replacing the tri-merge credit score model with a bi-merge system to cut costs. Already long from $1700 yesterday, we're down close to 30% on a remark that thinks a $1.50 increase in its wholesale royalty for mortgage originations is too high. The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.\n\n[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\-The stock has been on a monster run, and I'm interested in the short today. We've gone from \\~$50 to \\~$120 at the peak premarket, watching $100 level to see if we bounce off it or if we continue selling off. Most immediate risk I foresee is massive volatility; we're in speculation territory when it comes to this stock now.\n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\-Reports suggest the insurer made covert payments to nursing homes to limit hospital transfers, aiming to reduce costs, raising concerns over care practices. I won't include the context because I'm sure all of you are sick to death (this is a joke) of hearing about it from Reddit. Broke the $300 level again to the downside, interested to see if this will dump in the open and may try to play a small bounce in this. I exited my main position yesterday (thank god), but looking for other places to enter.\n\n**Earnings today:** [**INTU**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTU&p=d), [**WDAY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WDAY&p=d)\n\n**IPO Today:** HNGE",

Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. \n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \\~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**,** [**YINN (China Bull 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YINN&p=d)**,** [**YANG (China Bear 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YANG&p=d)**,** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\\- China-related stocks are selling off due to expectations of retaliation from the US. Also currently just a \"watch\", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100. If the US announces escalation of tariffs, I'm mainly interested in a YANG buy. This is potentially the largest catalyst since COVID, so one tweet can move the market.\n\nPlease remember YINN/YANG are not meant to be held intraday.",

So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.\n\nRECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically \"perfect company.\" The dream attributes of such a company go as:\n\n***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***\n\nCompanies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.\n\nMy examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)\n\n***It Does Something Dull:***\n\nCompanies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.\n\nMy examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)\n\n***It Does Something Disagreeable:***\n\nBusinesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.\n\nMy Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)\n\n***It’s a Spinoff:***\n\nCorporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.\n\nFound a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)\n\n***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***\n\nStocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These \"ignored\" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.\n\nMy examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)\n\n***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***\n\nLynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.\n\nMy examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)\n\n***There’s Something Depressing About It:***\n\nCompanies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.\n\nMy examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)\n\n***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.\n\nMy examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)\n\n***It’s Got a Niche:***\n\nA strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits\n\nMy examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)\n\n***People Have to Keep Buying It:***\n\nLynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.\n\nMy examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)\n\n***It's a User of Technology:***\n\nCompanies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.\n\nMy examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)\n\n***The Insiders are Buyers:***\n\nInsider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nMy examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)\n\n***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***\n\nCompanies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.\n\nMy examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",

Escalation of trade tariffs are the main risk here, whether these will be repealed or not, VIX will probably increase over the next few days.\n\n[**BAH (Booz Allen Hamilton Holding)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BAH&p=d)\\-BAH reported Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.61, meeting expectations, with revenue of $2.97B vs $3.02B. Provided FY26 guidance below consensus, projecting adjusted EPS of $6.20-$6.55 vs $6.87, and revenue of $12.0-$12.5B vs $12.8B exp.

However, the stock and the underlying sold off mainly due to Trump comments. Pretty much moves with the underlying, currently trading at 1.74x multiple to the amount of C it holds. We're in a weird spot where the stock is \"historically\" at  a lower multiplier than usual but essentially near ATH. Possibly interested in a buy if we sell off hard today, otherwise more interested in the market stocks. ",

The tariff escalation adds further pressure- Apple has flown literal planeloads of iPhones out of China but that's obviously a stop-gap measure. We've seen AAPL fall to $169, massively beyond what I could have even hoped. Still flat this but probably the #1 play if expecting a tariff reversal- the White House and Trump have signaled that tariffs are here to stay. Currently long a little from $170, but will bail if we hit those prices premarket/at the open.  \n\n**Related Tickers:** AVGO, QCOM, SWKS (all iPhone part manufacturers)\n\n[**WMT (Walmart)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WMT&p=d), [**TGT (Target)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TGT&p=d)\\-WMT scraps quarterly operating income forecast, citing Trump’s tariffs. They did cite net sales growing 3-4% this year. WMT backing away from guidance signals the \"we are in danger\" alarm over tariff impact on import costs and consumer demand even with net sales growing. TGT, with similar exposure, is likely to experience margin pressure in coming quarters. Margins are squeezed massively (and retailers are likely to take a loss on some goods simply because it's untenable to continue selling for a loss). \n\n[**DAL (Delta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAL&p=d)\\- CEO states Trump tariffs are hurting bookings, and was unable to reaffirm guidance. Forecasted Q2 EPS of $1.70–$2.30 vs. $2.23 est. Revenue to range -2% - +2% YoY vs. +1.9% est. Tariff fears hitting forward travel demand are a red flag, especially international bookings. Airlines face multiple macro pressures—tariffs, softening travel sentiment, currency exchange fluctuations, etc, overall a different set of circumstances from COVID yet as deadly. \n\n[**TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TLT&p=d)\\-Massive afterhours move as China sells U.S. Treasuries, resulting in a 5 point move afterhours. Bloomberg is also citing an unwind of popular hedge fund trade. The scale and consistency of the move suggest a structural shift, not just positioning. Treasury market dislocation is raising systemic risk signals across asset classes. I think we've hit roughly \\~5% for the 20 year which is a big deal- China dumping treasuries means that yields go up but exacerbate inflation in the short term, and add to volatility.\n\n[**HUM (Humana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HUM&p=d), [**CVS (CVS Health)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CVS&p=d), [**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\-Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage payment rate increases for 2026. The unexpected increase in reimbursement rates is a huge tailwind for these providers, improving profit outlooks into 2026. We saw a spike in these health insurance names and subsequent selloff, interested in seeing if we make any sort of upward move today. (Addendum: Trump announced that pharma tariffs are also incoming, which may be the reason why we saw so many of these pull back). \n\n[**VXX (Volatility Index)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)/[**UVXY (ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UVXY&p=d)/[**SVIX (Short VIX)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SVIX&p=d)\\-Volatility spike continues, but might be moving to shorting calls rather than shorting shares due to short locate issues.

Watching $214/$215 in AAPL and seeing if we can make another move higher. Currently long. Obviously this is a 90-day suspension and not actually a guarantee that things will return back to normal. Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) **/** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\\- Chinese tech stocks like BABA and JD are also major winners of tariffs, with both up roughly 6%, following the 90-day agreement. Watching $135 level (basically just seeing which Chinese stocks are close to breaking highs). Risks are the same as American stocks. Other notable stocks I like on this are BIDU/TCEHY (trades OTC)\n\n[**PFE (Pfizer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d) **/** [**MRK (Merck)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRK&p=d) **/** [**JNJ (Johnson & Johnson)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JNJ&p=d)\\- Trump announced plans to sign an executive order implementing a \"most-favored-nation\" policy to reduce U.S. prescription drug prices by up to 59%. This policy aims to \"align\" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).\n\n[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)\\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids. BP is considered undervalued, with a market cap of £57B against asset valuations of \\~£120B. No levels I'm watching at this time. Notably, the last piece of meaningful news on this that I remember was Eliot Management taking a stake, so it pushes the likelihood that they're getting acquired up incrementally.",

Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. \n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. \n\n[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.\n\n[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).\n\nEarnings: PLTR/HIMS/F",

        "selftext": "Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&P 500 down \\~9%, Nasdaq off \\~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?\n\nThe **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:\n\n✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals\n\n✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly\n\n✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements\n\nHis strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.\n\nNot every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g \n\n* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits\n* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel\n* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power\n* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs\n* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge\n* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump\n* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners\n\nCompanies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g\n\n* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk\n* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins\n* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs\n* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production\n* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs\n* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers\n* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders \n\nAre you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?\n\n  \nTrump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.\n\nThe problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, September 16th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await major Fed decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/15/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-investors-await-major-fed-decision-live-updates.html)\n*****\n> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.\n*****\n> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.\n*****\n> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.\n*****\n> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.\n*****\n> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.\n*****\n> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.\n*****\n> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/JeXzAYR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Md5UMKo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/sVxpfGU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/G9jtrZ5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/fqLKXyh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/L4mNSBX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uKAl54m.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/WZb12Gv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BJzVcBV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Gc325TT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/qMjgcOp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/0k12aGQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E9zVA8r.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/z9ng4cU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/FYLfnGf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/nPDYney.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-mu-aapl-intc-aa-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Trump Media & Technology** — Shares rose more than 1%, extending the 11% gain from Friday.

My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I don’t understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted?

        "selftext": "https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24341039/meta-apple-mark-zuckerberg-trash-talks-joe-rogan-interview\n\n> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks Apple “[hasn’t] really invented anything great in a while” and that it has been coasting off of its past success. “Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,” he said this week. Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies.\n\n> The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said.\n\n> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025. It’s one world.”",

And the reason, as one might guess, is artificial intelligence.\n\n> That may seem like a silly thing for Apple to say, given that more than half of its revenue is iPhone sales. But Cue calls AI a “huge technological shift,” and suggests that such shifts can humble companies that once seemed unassailable. “When I got to Silicon Valley,” he said, “all the best companies or the most successful companies” — he mentioned HP, Sun Microsystems, and Intel — “either don’t exist today or are significantly smaller and much less impactful.”",

The company’s shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.\n\nIn 2014, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple’s tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant’s headquarters in the EU.\n\nThe Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received “illegal” tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.\n\nApple and Ireland appealed the Commission’s decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU’s second-highest court anulled the Commission’s 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.\n\nThe Commission in turn appealed the General Court’s decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.\n\nThe case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.\n\nThis was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU’s crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nSeparately, the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/apple-loses-eu-court-battle-over-13-billion-euro-tax-bill-in-ireland.html",

        "selftext": "Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.\n\nThe chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThe selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. \n\nNvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”\n\nThe analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”\n\nBut after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.\n\nData center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.\n\nFor Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.\n\nNvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.\n\nThe sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.\n\n“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.\n\nNvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-sheds-almost-600-billion-in-market-cap-biggest-drop-ever.html",

Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a \"potential supercycle\" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.\n\nIn my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.\n\nTo me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.\n\nHere’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!\n\nTl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft\n\nP.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",

Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren’t made in the US. Setting up domestic manufacturing would take years.\n\nThe products that won’t be subject to Trump’s new tariffs also include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US as well as other chipmakers.\n\nThe tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China.\n\nOne such exclusion was for semiconductors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn’t yet done so but the latest exclusions appear to correspond with that exemption. Trump’s sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25%, though it’s not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be.\n\n",

        "title": "The era of American stock market exceptionalism is over",
        "selftext": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first\n\nNearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.\nOver the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.\n\nWhile it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.\nTom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.\nOne of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.\n\nSince 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”\nHowever, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.\n\nThe upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.\n\nAll of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.\nIn fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.\nMarkets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.\nMr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.\n“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”\n",

        "selftext": "President Trump plans to impose tariffs of up to 100% on chips produced in Taiwan, targeting companies like TSMC, which supplies Apple, Nvidia, and AMD. The tariffs aim to encourage more chip production in the US, with Trump criticizing the CHIPS and Science Act for providing funds to companies that already have significant resources. The policy may cause price hikes for various computer products, as it takes years to build chip factories. TSMC-made chips are typically not exported directly to the US, but rather sent to other countries for assembly into consumer electronics.

Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered.

The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

Let’s say apple is buying back half of its outstanding shares with its free reserve. I have 100 shares of AAPL which I bought yesterday for 100 dollars totally(1$ per share). I sell 50 of those 100 shares and get 50$ as compensation and hold the remaining 50 shares.\n\nNow, since there are only half the outstanding shares as before the EPS doubles. Since it has doubled, the price doubles too to match the PE ratio as before(Assuming the forecast of the company future cashflows with or without the free reserve stays the same). In such case, my remaining 50 shares are now worth 100$. Upon selling I finally have 150$ in my account.\n\nDoes the existence of such loophole mean, the EPS rising as a result of buybacks dont have a say in the future price of the stock and that market capitalisation decreases after stock buyback?",

We have a lot of users calling for Fed to cut interest rates, in hope that the rate cut will push economic growth and reduce treasury yield. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to increase interest rate, so it makes USD more appealing and reduces treasury yield. Regardless, treasury yield keeps going up. The same story of basis trade and carry trade is playing again today.\n\nIt is debatable whether we want a stronger dollar or a weak dollar, but reducing treasury yield seems to be the common goal. How could we easily create more demands for U.S. treasury bonds, when both sides of the aisle embraces the deficit expansion to the core? Well, we can force people into buying treasury bonds, we can wage a war to scare people, or we can create some phantom demands. This is where the GENIUS act may come handy.\n\nThe grand scheme is to bring assets on-chain, which requires the players to escrow real-world-assets (RWAs) and issue tokens backed with it. Geez, this sounds like mortgage backed securities and ETF already. To trade those assets, we need currencies, mostly the stablecoins. The GENIUS Act requires holding of USD or treasury bonds, which the issuers will gladly support. Let us imagine that we move NYSE and NASDAQ on-chain and create a copy of all stocks, we suddenly create demand for USD, treasury, and stocks from some users that can't access the U.S. market. Even our dear general Kim can tornado his stash and buy Apple at that time.\n\nWait! This already happened! Kraken tokenized AAPL, NVDA and TSLA today. Many other crypto firms have worked on RWA for years, including stocks, game skins, etc. GAINS even created a 100x leveraged stock trading platform until they halted it due to heavy admin burden to monitor stock earning, dividends, splits, acquisitions, etc.\n\nSo we are likely to see a concerted effort to push assets on-chain in the coming months or years, which will benefit stocks like COIN, HOOD, XYZ, PYPL, and other players, and cryptos such as LINK. Electronic stablecoin payments for daily life is another direction, and I wonder how that will affect V and MA. The damage to both may take years though.\n\nToo bad I didn't scoop HOOD at low, but I bought all above anyway.",

        "title": "Active IRA management vs index funds and ETFs?",
        "selftext": "I’m curious to know where people stand on whether they think they should place their own trades in IRA accounts vs buying index funds and etfs. I’m on the side of active only because I know what I’m doing especially during high volatility when I’m able to pick up stocks at lower prices during or after selloffs. This concentrated buying has allowed me to see pretty big upside when the stock rebounds especially if it rises more than the index. The risks of this is that SPY/QQQ has been rising consistently. I have been really conservative about buying tech thinking the market will pull back and I have missed out big as a result. My YTD would be around 30-40% if I didn’t sell my positions early but that’s life. \n\nMe (Roth IRA): 19.35% YTD\n\nMy 401k: 15.27%\n\nS&P: 18.61% YTD\n\nNasdaq 100: 20.83% YTD\n\nMy biggest winners include\n\n-RKLB. 37.92%. $4.05. I think this is a 5-10 year play. I buy on dips. I’m too afraid to sell covered calls on this for fear of the price running without me.\n\n-Arm bought near 52 week low and sold around $80 thinking it was overvalued… I bought back with a small stake at $120 begrudgingly only to see it rise to $170.\n\n-hood. Bought at $8, sold for $9.50…. Thought it would keep ping ponging. Bought back at $20 and will average down if need be but the company is not going out of business\n\n-rivn. Up 35% YTD, my biggest position. I bought slightly high but kept averaging down. I actually believe in the company. Cost basis $12.94.\n\n-aapl. Up 20% YTD. I have a small stake because I kept waiting for Apple to drop to $130 before rising to $200 which did not happen. Cost basis $195.\n\n-Bcrx. Up 58% YTD. I’ve known this bio company for almost a decade now. They ping pong so it’s mostly cyclical. $4.65 cost basis \n\n-cava. Up 26% YTD. Kicking myself for not buying more. \n\n-SG. Bought at like $9, sold at like $13. Kicking myself. I bought after reading about their subscription service and seeing how people are paying $20 for their orders\n\n-FBTC. Up 16.98%. Cost basis $47.14. Bitcoin is here to stay like it or not. Wish I didn’t penny pinch when trying to buy 100 shares of MSTR 2 years ago for $500. \n\n-HUM. +19.52%, $323.75. Healthcare is expensive and this company is not going out of business so I buy dips.\n\n-KWEB. +17.52%, $23.90. China will rebound, well at least Chinese tech. \n\n-Lmnd. +25.08%, $16.16. Saw a report on their business model and it gives headaches but can work if they survive the growing pains. I think they are here to stay and will probably get to $60 in the next 5 years.\n\n-Meta. +19.29%, $420. I actually bought Meta at $115 during the crazy but got spooked when it dropped below $110, I sold for a profit but kicked myself for not holding. I believe in the company and they are just getting started revenue wise in my opinion. So many AI plays here. Regretting not having the cash to load up this time around. \n\n-NFTY. +15.23%. $53.77. India will probably keep growing. This stock also pays a good dividend. \n\n-RBRK. +13.75. $30.83. Cybersecurity is growing. I also have positive numbers in Palo Alto which I buy on earnings drops\n\n-snap. +42.52%. $11.33. Snap is not going out of business. The stock drops after earnings so I just buy then and wait for a rebound. It’s one of my largest holdings. Wish I dumped more cash and wish it would drop when the market drops but it’s held firm the last few months\n\n-Z. +23.83%. $40.83. Bought during the sell off when the courts ruled against the industry. Zillow will be fine. \n\n\nI actually don’t have many losers. The stakes are small.\n\n-Aal. -14.41%. $12.54. I think it will bounce back in a year or two. \n\n-CGC. -15.33%. $7.52. I don’t know much about weed but figured I’d buy a small stake just in case.\n\n-MSOS. -14.19%. $8.70. Small stakes in weed, lottery ticket\n\n-WBD. -15.88%. $8.66. The worst buy I’ve made. Figured might as well keep it.\n\n-Snow. -13.67%. $154.53. I knew I was buying high with snowflake but didn’t expect the big drop. The stake is not big. I still do believe in the company.\n\n-Dis. -9.94%. $107.54. Knew I was buying high, my fault really. Thankfully not a big position and Disney will bounce back.\n\n-Hubs. -17.29%. $570.91. Tiny stake. I actually like the current price and will buy around $420.\n\n-CMG. -7.08%. $61.36. Knew I was buying high but long term hold.\n\n-PZZA. -7.84%. $45.74. One of my larger stakes. Papa John’s is at a 4-5 year low which is crazy to me since their numbers are not bad. It’s a cyclical play if you look at the chart. Plus the company is not going out of business. Worst case scenario is this drops to high $20s which do don’t know how that can even happen. I’ll keep buying weekly. ",

Then this past week I read \"The Retirement Time Bomb Ticks Louder\" by Ed Slott, and it only reinforced what I was already thinking. \n\nHigher tax rates are coming, and sooner or later the government is going to target 401k's and IRA's. The old adage of \"tax deferred when you are working so you can withdraw it and be taxed at a lower rate later\" is likely not true. We are, right now, likely in the lowest tax bracket we will ever be. \n\nTherefore, is anyone else thinking like Buffett? Anyone taking capital gains now, even without offsetting losses?

Markets were encouraged by those moves, as investors felt relief from the economic uncertainty and instability Trump’s tariffs had threatened to create.\n> \n> But Trump “believes that the EU proposals have not been of the same quality that we’ve seen from our other important trading partners,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox News interview Friday morning.\n> \n> Asked if the EU will be able to negotiate in the nine days before the 50% tariffs kick in, Bessent said, “I would hope that this would light a fire under the EU.”\n> \n> Trump’s posts tee up a potentially tense exchange between U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and his European counterpart later Friday. Greer is expected to tell European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic in a meeting that Brussels’ latest move in ongoing trade talks fails to meet U.S. expectations, the FT reported.\n> \n> The EU was the second-largest purchaser of U.S. exports in 2022, taking in nearly $351 billion of American goods, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n> \n> The EU’s main executive body, the European Commission, declined CNBC’s request for comment on Trump’s new tariff threat.\n> \n> Trump has long accused Europe of taking unfair advantage of the U.S. through trade. He announced a blanket 20% tariff on the EU on April 2 as part of his “reciprocal” tariff plan, though he quickly revised that duty down to 10% for 90 days.\n> \n> Europe is also dealing with Trump’s sector-specific tariffs, including a 25% levy on all steel and aluminum imports.\n> \n> “To go to 10% was going to be the highest tariff rate that we had on the world in 90 years. To go to 50% is a completely different order of magnitude,” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Friday morning on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\n> \n> “If they’re putting in place tariffs that have a stagflationary impact, which is to say they slowed down output by raising the cost of production while also raising prices, then that’s the Central Bank’s worst situation,” Goolsbee said.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/23/trump-recommends-50percent-tariff-on-european-union-starting-june-1.html",

I'm a new investor and Fidelity intimidates me a little bit. But since these will be set-it and forget-it accounts, I don't know how much weight I want to put into that since I don't plan on regularly using them. I am an Apple Card user and just found out about Apple's HYSA and think the UI point applies here as well.\n\nI like the idea of using Fidelity so everything is simple and in one place. I've read about putting the money into FDLXX instead of SPAXX since it's state/local tax-exempt. Overall, the CMA seems like a really good option compared to a HYSA, I just don't understand it as much at the moment.\n\nI'm not keen on rate chasing. I want simplicity and to automate/set and forget my investing/ savings.

        "title": "🎭 \"Tariff Theater\": Why the 7% Rally Is a Mirage, Not a Market Rebound",
        "selftext": "The recent 7% rally in equities, coinciding with the Trump administration’s decision to roll back certain tariffs to 10%, has been interpreted by some as the beginning of a broader policy shift. In reality, the fundamental landscape remains unchanged. If anything, the superficial nature of the rollback only highlights the extent to which markets have latched onto optics in the absence of substantive improvement. This rally in equities has not been mirrored by the bond market.\n\nThe core dynamics of U.S. trade remain adversarial. China, the United States' largest goods supplier, continues to face high and sustained tariff exposure. The aggregate effective rate, factoring in prior rounds of reciprocal escalation, remains above 100% in several key categories. The European Union has not softened its stance, and in many areas, has reinforced its commitment to retaliatory measures. These are not temporary frictions; they are structural conflicts driven by divergent regulatory philosophies and increasingly protectionist trade regimes.\n\nThe administration’s trade team has pointed to limited agreements with smaller economies as signs of progress. But these are largely symbolic, wins on paper that have little bearing on global supply chains or multinational corporate strategy. For firms with cross-border exposure, especially in manufacturing, technology, and retail, the operating environment remains materially constrained. Cost structures have not normalized, logistics remain fragile, and geopolitical uncertainty continues to inhibit capital deployment.\n\nMultinational firms, Apple being a key example, have not seen operational relief. Their upstream suppliers are still entangled in the broader tariff gridlock, and downstream demand remains vulnerable to price transmission effects. Margins are thinning, and strategic flexibility is diminishing as firms are forced to hedge against policy volatility rather than invest into expansion.\n\nBeneath the surface, core macroeconomic indicators point to a deteriorating environment. Unemployment, while still moderate by historical standards, is trending upward. Real wage growth has stalled. Inflation, particularly in services and shelter, remains persistently elevated, even as headline CPI shows deceleration. Consumer credit delinquencies are rising. These are not the foundations of a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe current rally in equities is not being underwritten by earnings strength. On the contrary, forward guidance across several sectors has been revised downward, and earnings compression is visible in both nominal and real terms. What we are seeing in markets is not confidence, it is positioning. With liquidity abundant and volatility elevated, capital is rotating into risk on technicals, not fundamentals.\n\nTo complicate matters further, market behavior is beginning to resemble that of the late 1980s. Volatility is no longer episodic, it is persistent. The Federal Reserve’s posture remains hawkish, and the long end of the yield curve continues to rise, undermining equity valuations and tightening financial conditions in the real economy. At the same time, geopolitical dislocation is contributing to a growing perception that U.S. assets, once the global default for safe and productive capital, are no longer as insulated as they once were.\n\nForeign capital inflows are beginning to waver, and the strength of the dollar, long a source of stability, is now a headwind for export competitiveness. In this context, the idea that a marginal tariff adjustment constitutes a policy breakthrough is difficult to justify. If anything, it highlights how thin the narrative support for this rally truly is.\n\nUntil there is a credible de-escalation of trade tensions with China and the EU, a normalization of inflation and labor market conditions, and a return to earnings-led equity performance, the market remains structurally fragile. The recent rally is not a signal of recovery. It is a speculative drift, driven by hope, not data.\n\nInvestors would do well to treat it accordingly.",

But why?\n\nSome believe he is anticipating a market crash, although historically, timming the market has never been his investment strategy. Others argue that the market is overvalued, but even in such conditions, experienced investors can still find good opportunities (Berkshire bought Apple in 2016, when everyone thought it was overvalued, and ended up giving extraordinary returns).\n\nIn my opinion, Buffett may be preparing the company for a long-term strategic move: ensuring that Berkshire has enough capital to buy back its own shares after his passing.\n\nIt is well known that Warren Buffett does not believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). He and other *value investing* advocates have demonstrated in practice that markets can be irrational in the short term, creating opportunities for those who are patient and disciplined.\n\nWhat’s your opinion?",

I’d have more value to my name.\n\nTo look at it I viewed an era that had large fluctuations in which I invested in which lead me to 2019 to 2024 because in-between that we had the fed-induced boom and the crash that came before that along with other crazy fluctuations.\n\nSo for my example I used march 2019 to March 2024 (which had steep decreases and increases):\n\n1.MSFT: 250.92% \n2.Apple: 248%\n3.Meta: 176.44%\n4.Googl: 149%\n5.Amazon: 96.46%\n\n1.QQQ: 140.45%\n2.VTI: 84.34%\n3.VOO: 81.39%\n4.VT: 54.38%\n\nHere is the Summary of percentages those sticks hold for each ETF:\n\n1.

I predict the next trend will be robotics. It is highly linked to AI, but hasn't seen any attention. As AI grows, robots will be implemented more into our daily lives, a process which will require robotics & robotic parts. Furthermore, these sectors can also have military applications, which will increase the eventual demand, and provides potential for further growth.\n\nHere are my speculative robotics stock picks, which have upside potential if the industry takes off. I included two volatile penny stocks and two stabler bets. I also included parts to show how much of each I would recommend in proportion to a total robotics portfolio, I will probably just invest $1000-$2000, with the specified allocations (maybe heavier on draganfly because I believe their company has a lot of upside potential and I have a high risk tolerance):\n\nDraganfly inc (2 parts): Canadian based, which means that if retaliatory tariffs are implemented they could still trade worldwide. They create drones & other software, for a variety of purposes: agriculture, military, energy, and public 'safety' (potentially surveillance). I predict robotics adoption in all these fields, which would bring success of the company. They have a decent board of directors, rated a strong buy by two analysts, and a low sh0rt interest, which hints a likely upside, and reduces potential of the company being driven to the ground that way. (Ticker: DPRO | $1.77 USD | 18.76M market cap.)\n\nIrobot corp (1 part): US based, make primarily robot vacuum cleaners. They have great revenue (about 6x market cap), so if they could manage a profit their share would do incredibly well. Their share is near 52 week lows. If they diversify into other robotics sectors, they could grow tremendously. I would place a conservative bet into this company, as them diversifying into other sectors would be a big if. (Ticker: IRBT | $2.79 USD | 86.78M market cap)\n\nTeradyne INC (3 parts): They make robots for various industries, including military and industrial. Tech could be used for civilian applications. (Ticker: TER | $81.27 USD | 13.04B market cap)\n\nRockwell automation (4 parts): They have 27 000 employees, and are already a large player in the robotics industry, yet they still have lots of room to grow. Established, profitable company with P/E ratio comparable to apple, and a dividend of about 1 percent. The reason NVIDIA stock grew is largely their AI hardware, and Rockwell does a lot of robotics hardware. (Ticker: ROK | $307.85 USD | $34.70B market cap)",

Since unveiling Apple Intelligence on June 10, Apple stock has risen by 21% ($700 billion) on analyst predictions of an “upgrade supercycle.” Moderna stock shot up 60% higher in May after announcing a partnership with Open AI.\n\nEventually, this will give way to a “show me the money” phase in which investors need to see actual profits to sustain these valuations. But clearly we’re not there yet. For the companies selling shovels in the current gold rush (NVIDIA, TSMC, etc.) they’re generating spectacular earnings right now, but the question is how sustainable they’ll be for the longer term. Wall Street has their earnings growth priced in as being permanent.\n\nPossible turning points:\n\nApple will release its AI-enhanced iPhone 16 this autumn. If sales are weak, it’ll be clear that consumers aren’t as jazzed up about AI as markets are predicting. But the last few years haven’t had any notable upgrades at all, so there could still be an upgrade cycle.\n\nOn the corporate side, it’s harder to predict. Corporations including financial services & other non-tech industries have been willing to pay Microsoft & Open AI hand over fist because it’s the latest hot technology; mentioning AI boosts their stock prices; and they’re always looking for ways to boost efficiency.\n\nFor Big Tech, there’s a widespread belief that this is a can’t-fail arms race, given the winner-takes-all nature of the industry. Therefore, it’s possible that even if consumers aren’t too hyped about AI, Big Tech corporations will gladly continue to pay NVIDIA billions every year. Especially since M&A has grinded to a halt due to regulatory scrutiny, they have to find something to do with all this money.\n\nCentral banks:\n\nOn top of all this, you have central banks around the world itching to ease and pump markets higher. Alan Greenspan’s 1995 rate cuts likely extended the life of the first Internet bubble by a few years. But at least he recognized it was a bubble and popped it in 2000 by raising rates, even as inflation was below-target & decelerating. Jerome Powell, who’s worth over $50 million and highly invested in stocks, has said he’d do no such thing, and only high inflation can lead to more rate hikes.\n\n—\n\nWhat are your thoughts? How high will the market & tech valuations go? Will this lead to a market crash or a new plateau?\n\n",

Overall, am I beating the market? - I am not sure with rollovers from one job to the next that don’t keep track of previous account gains. But I am not loosing either with the strategy. How do you keep this urge/itch away? Just keeping it in S&P 500 is so boring. \n\nEDIT: based on comments I want to add that I do gamble in casinos table games but not more than $500-$1000 a year.

But my rationale says that even if these economies grow, it's the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most. For example, as poor countries gain more disposable incomes, they'll be able to buy more expensive products like iPhones and MacBooks. So this will help the Apple stock grow not the stock of some company in these emerging economies. That's not to say those companies won't grow at all, sure they will with increased internal demand, but the developed world has more to gain from the growth of the emerging economies. Also, most internal growth will come from international companies opening their manufacturing plants in emerging economies like Apple and Samsung manufacturing in India.

        "selftext": "Someone asked me recently, *“What would you pay for Berkshire Hathaway?”* Thought I’d open it up here because I think it’s a pretty relevant question right now.\n\nBerkshire’s not a typical company. It’s part operating business, part investment portfolio. You’re getting businesses like Geico and BNSF, but also huge public holdings in Apple, Coca-Cola, AmEx, and more. Plus a massive cash position, well over $100 billion.\n\nSo how do you value that?\n\nFirst, I look at **book value**. Historically, Berkshire trades around 1.3 to 1.5 times book. But with interest rates rising and market multiples normalizing, that should compress.\n\nWarren Buffett himself has said he would buy back shares at **1.2 times book value or below** if he believes the stock is trading below intrinsic value. That is a pretty strong signal, and it gives us a decent benchmark.\n\nSecond, I look at **earnings power**. Between its operating businesses and its investment portfolio, Berkshire is still a cash machine. But it is no longer a 20 percent compounding machine like it was in its early days. The law of large numbers applies here.\n\nIf I had to name a number today, I would start getting interested around that 1.2x book value range. Maybe lower depending on how the macro looks. Anything much higher and I do not see the margin of safety.\n\nWould love to hear how others are approaching Berkshire. Are you a buyer here, or are you waiting for a pullback? How do you factor in the Apple position or Buffett’s eventual departure?",

This sparked a lot of discussion, with valid concerns that this time might actually be different. Interest rates are high. Stock prices seem expensive. There’s talk of recession, tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty, and massive government debt. Investors are rightly asking: **Are we heading for a lost decade?**\n\nSo I did some research and sharing my conclusion below. This is based on my understanding, and would appreciate feedback and different perspectives.\n\nFor most investors, the thought of spending ten years in a market that goes nowhere is unsettling. But it's entirely possible and has happened before multiple times. Certain eras in market history earned the nickname “lost decade” because stock prices failed to sustainably recover for 10 years or more. The most notable and often cited examples are:\n\n* **Great Depression of 1929:** Stocks collapsed nearly 90%, and the economy fell apart. The market didn’t recover for decades. It took massive government spending during World War II to reignite growth.\n* **The Stagflation ‘70s:** Inflation soared past 14%, oil shocks rocked the global economy, and interest rates were pushed up to 20%. The result? Stocks barely moved for a decade, losing purchasing power to inflation.\n* **The Dot-Com Bust & Financial Crisis (2000-2010):** First, the dot-com bubble popped, wiping out overvalued tech stocks. Then, just as the market started recovering, the 2008 financial crisis hit, dragging the economy into a deep recession. It took more than a decade for markets to fully recover.\n* **Japan’s Lost Decades (1989-Present):** The worst example of all. In the late 1980s, Japan was the hottest economy in the world—until a massive asset bubble popped. Stocks crashed, real estate values collapsed, and economic growth never fully returned. More than 30 years later, Japan’s stock market has just begun to surpass it’s all time high reached in 1989.\n\n# While these periods had different triggers and circumstances, they all shared a few common characteristics:\n\n1. **High stock market valuations at the start.** When investors pay too much for stocks, future returns tend to be disappointing, even if the economy grows.\n2. **Debt was excessive.** Whether it was households, corporations, or governments, excessive borrowing created major financial drag.\n3. **Big economic disruptions followed.** Inflation in the ‘70s, a financial system breakdown in the 2000s, and deflation in Japan—each one created a decade of stagnation\n4. **Government responses often made things worse.** Central banks and policymakers either moved too slowly or responded in ways that prolonged economic pain.\n5. **Long-term structural drags slowed recoveries.** Aging populations, slowing workforce growth, and weak productivity made it harder for economies to bounce back.\n\n**Now, let’s compare that to today.**\n\n* **Stock market valuations are high, but not in bubble territory.** The S&P 500’s valuation is elevated, much like before the 2000s lost decade. The current Schiller P/E ratio (price to cyclically adjusted earnings) is well above the historical average. But today’s leading companies—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta —are highly profitable and are driving real earnings growth, unlike the speculative tech stocks of 2000.\n* **Inflation is cooling but remains higher than ideal.** Unlike the 1970s, where inflation spiraled out of control going as high as 14%, today’s price pressures are slowly easing and much more moderate (2.8% as per latest inflation report). Supply chains are improving, and AI-driven productivity gains could help keep costs in check.\n* **Debt is a major concern—but it’s not as out of control.** U.S. government debt is at record levels, limiting future stimulus options. But unlike 2008, household and corporate debt are under control. Banks are better capitalized, and there’s no widespread financial system breakdown looming.\n* **Geopolitical risks are real, but markets have absorbed them so far.** Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, ongoing wars, and the shift toward deglobalization continue to be key risks.\n* **Demographics are a mixed bag.** The U.S. workforce is aging (Avg age. 39), but still younger than Japan during early 2000s (Avg age 48). Immigration and higher workforce participation rates still give the economy more resilience than Japan or Europe.\n* **The biggest wildcard is AI and automation.** A hopeful difference today is the pace of technological innovation. The late 1920s had new tech (radio, automobiles) but the Depression cut investment in them. The 1970s paradoxically saw relatively slow productivity growth (despite the IT revolution being on the horizon, its benefits weren’t felt until the 1980s–90s). Today, we’re on the cusp of another tech-driven productivity boom – chiefly due to artificial intelligence and automation. If AI can boost efficiency significantly, it could raise economic growth in the latter part of this decade. Goldman Sachs predicts generative AI could eventually lift GDP by \\~7% over a decade. Such a boost would be a stark difference from past lost decades, which generally lacked a positive productivity shock to offset their drags. Right now a lot of it seems hype. But if AI delivers on its promise without displacing jobs at large scale, it can lead to an unprecedented boom and a period of huge wealth creation.\n\n**So while there are risks, this is not the same setup as past lost decades.**\n\nWhile history never repeats exactly, it does rhyme. Today we see echoes of past pre-crisis extremes – high stock valuations and heavy debts – combined with new challenges like aging demographics and geopolitical shifts. **However, we also see crucial differences: inflation is being actively managed (not runaway as in the ’70s), our financial system (banks and corporates) is more robust than before the 2008 crisis, and potential growth drivers (AI, etc.) could emerge to surprise on the upside**.\n\nInstead of lost decade, **we appear to be headed towards a muddled decade** — some ups, some downs, growth in some specific sectors, and at least some modest growth, even if lower than previous decade.\n\nOf course, this can change as events play out in the world in coming months and years. There may be major natural disasters that disrupt global supply chains or something else. But as things stand now, the more probable outcome is a decade of lower returns than previous decade rather than complete stagnation.\n\n**What does it mean for you?** Investors who expect 10-12% annual returns just through index investing, like in the 2010s, may be disappointed. But those who adapt—focusing on quality companies, dividends, and emerging growth areas like AI—could still emerge out wealthier and stronger.",

        "title": "Bitcoin Isn’t Unique But Infinite—$100K Is Beyond Absurd",
        "selftext": "Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it’s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, “Only 21 million bottles will ever exist.” They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.\n\nBut here’s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn’t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it’s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.\n\nThink about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system—one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants—to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing—they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin’s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.\n\nThis brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.\n\nStocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.\n\nFiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers—companies, governments, or individuals—to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.\n\nCryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing—no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.\n\nBitcoin’s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, “We’re only producing 21 million bottles.” The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.\n\nThe absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.\n\nBitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin’s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin’s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren’t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they’re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.\n\nThis speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.\n\nBitcoin isn’t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It’s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.\n\nWhen the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin’s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",

        "title": "Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase",
        "selftext": "Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.\n\nAccording to a report in the Information, Apple — which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout — has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\n\nThe update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.\n\nLast year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.\n\nIt's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.\n\nAccording to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.\n\nNotably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like \"Severance,\" \"Shrinking,\" and \"Ted Lasso.\" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to \"Coda\").\n\nIn total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.\n\nApple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.\n\n\"Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,\" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. \"Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.\"\n\nIn January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",

Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.**\n\n**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**\n\nDISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.\n\n  \n“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”\n\n\\--Donald Trump, 1988\n\n\n\n[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.\n\nThis has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of \"loopholes\" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.\n\nTheir goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:\n\n* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that \"deindustrialization is a national security risk\".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that \"every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait.\" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.\n* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.\n\nSo, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.\n\nWhat does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that \"liberation day\" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to \"buy the dip.\" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.\n\n**\\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**\n\n**\"TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA\" --me**\n\n**\"THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP\" --me**\n\n**\"TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD\" --me**\n\nHowever, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of \"reducing the trade deficit with China\" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and \"reindustrialize\" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.\n\ntl;dr: Since the goal is to \"Reduce the trade deficit with China,\" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.\n\n**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**\n\nI think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.\n\nWho are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...\n\nNavarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is \"ripping off the world.\" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.\n\nAre these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:\n\n**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to \"decouple\" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**\n\n**He believes in \"short term pain,\" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the \"dependency\" on China.**\n\nSimply put:\n\nAAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.\n\nHowever, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the \"apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip\" reflex continues over the rest of the week.\n\n\\---\n\n**Epilogue**  \nUneducated peasants gave Mao Zedong power because he was an iconoclast that claimed he could save them from a feudalistic society. When in power, he instead implemented his theory that none of his base understood.\n\n45 million starved. The rest ate bark and dirt.",

According to reports, Apple will bring a series of anticipated new products in the spring of 2025, covering a number of popular product lines such as the iPhone SE, iPad and MacBook Air. Are investors ready for a new “super cycle”?**\n\n  \n**Monday, $ Apple (AAPL.US)$ closed up 0.95%, shares rose to $ 239.59, hitting a new record high, the total market capitalization exceeded 3.62 trillion U.S. dollars, regaining the first global market value throne, compared with the second place of the NVIDIA has been higher than 250 billion U.S. dollars.

The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?\n\n  \nOutstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.\n\nTechnology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.\n\nGlobal market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

        "selftext": "I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.\n\nIf chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.\n\nNow for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. You're paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.\n\nThat fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.\n\nI agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html)\n\nThere is one area that will benefit astronomically from AI but that will come a bit later.",

        "title": "Trimming Appl before Berkshire results tomorrow ",
        "selftext": "Investors may want to consider trimming their Apple (AAPL) positions based on recent developments and upcoming events. Here's why:\n\n## Apple's Recent Performance\n\nApple's latest earnings report has raised some concerns among investors. The company reported a decline in global iPhone sales for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to increased competition in China from companies like Huawei[3]. This slowdown in Apple's flagship product could signal challenges ahead for the tech giant.\n\n## Berkshire Hathaway's Significant Reduction\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) has made a notable move by cutting its stake in Apple by nearly 50% during the second quarter of 2024[1][2]. This reduction came after Berkshire had already trimmed its Apple holdings by 13% in the first quarter[1]. Such a significant divestment by a long-term, value-focused investor like Buffett could be interpreted as a cautionary signal.\n\n## Potential for Further Trimming\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway set to report earnings tomorrow, investors should pay close attention. Apple's stock price has risen by approximately $15 since the end of September when Berkshire made its substantial cut. This increase, coupled with Berkshire's recent selling pattern, suggests that another trim in Berkshire's Apple holdings is possible[4].\n\n## Broader Market Considerations\n\nBerkshire's actions may reflect broader concerns about the U.S. economy. The company has increased its cash reserves to a record $277 billion, which could indicate a more cautious outlook on equities in general[5]. This substantial cash position might be seen as a hedge against potential market volatility or economic uncertainty.\n\n## Investor Takeaway\n\nWhile Apple remains a strong company with significant market presence, these factors combined suggest that investors might want to reassess their positions:\n\n1. Apple's slowing iPhone sales and increased competition\n2. Berkshire's substantial reduction in Apple holdings\n3. The possibility of further trimming by Berkshire\n4. Overall market and economic uncertainties\n\nGiven that the onions for appl options will be down after earnings, this would be an excellent time to short appl. This is not financial advice.\n\nSources\n[1] Apple Stock Falls Amid Broad Selloff as Berkshire Hathaway Trims ... https://www.investopedia.com/apple-stock-falls-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-trims-stake-again-8690248\n[2] Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Cuts Stake in Apple by Half https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2024/buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-cuts-stake-in-apple-by-half/\n[3] Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sells half its Apple stock https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/03/warren-buffets-berkshire-hathaway-sells-half-its-apple-stock/\n[4] Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cuts stake in Apple by nearly ... https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/business/berkshire-hathaway-apple-stock/index.html\n[5] Berkshire Hathaway sells off large share of Apple and increases ... https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/03/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-sells-off-apple-increases-cash-holdings\n",

        "selftext": "Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since [the launch of ChatGPT ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[ a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html) in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n\nAhead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don’t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don’t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That’s what I did, and I’ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals.

        "title": "NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.",
        "selftext": "Hi regards,\n\nThis is not a \"copium\" post about the recent stock price drops.\n\nI am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest.\n\nThe problem with NVDA is that they are \"overhyped\" not \"overpriced\". Some of you regards might say that \"OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED\", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.\n\nFirst of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are \"worth now\".\n\n|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AAPL|230|1,4|164|\n|MSFT|413|2,95|140|\n|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|\n|META|516|5,16|100|\n|AMZN|171|1,26|135|\n|NVDA|116|0,68|170|\n\nAs you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.\n\nBut before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.\n\n## AAPL\n\nLatest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.\n\nHow do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.\n\nBut this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo \"Vision Pro\" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.\n\n## MSFT\n\nThey did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a \"everything\" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.\n\nThey are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.\n\nThey are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?\n\n## AMD\n\nI am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.\n\nAlso, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.\n\nEven if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.\n\nAnd no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section.\n\n## META\n\nThey are a \"AD\" company, just like Google. They have some \"long game\" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.\n\nALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.\n\n## AMZN\n\nThe \"everything company\". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.\n\n# NVDA\n\nAND OUR STAR CHILD.\nHOT TOPIC OF 2024.\nTHE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.\n\nDo you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.\n\nSo why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.\n\nRemember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?\n\nH100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.\n\nAnd I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.\n\nRemember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?\n\nLet the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.\n\nEDIT: forgor some words",

Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school.\n\nApril 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S\\*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts.  I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more.\n\nMay 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96%\n\nJune 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says \"APPLE INTELLIGENCE\", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June.\n\nJuly 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up \\~80-100% for the year.\n\nLook, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time.\n\nJuly 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week:  1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish.  Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0.\n\nToo hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times.\n\nOver the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are.\n\nAMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production.  $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck?  I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point.\n\nTLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October.   Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week.\n\nI'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS.\n\nThanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",

Apple's imports into the U.S. have so far escaped being hit since the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers and some other consumer electronic devices from \"reciprocal\" tariffs imposed in early April. \n\nApple shares dropped 3% on Friday to around $195, losing ground for the eighth consecutive session. The stock has lost 22% of its value since the start of 2025, significantly lagging the performance of its Magnificent Seven peers, as sentiment toward the company has soured due to its significant exposure to tariffs\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Apple’s chart and use technical analysis identify major price levels worth watching out for.\n\n**Descending Broadening Formation in Play**\n\nSince setting their record high in late December, Apple shares have trended lower within a descending broadening formation, with the price tagging the pattern’s upper and lower trendline on several occasions since that time.\n\nMore recently, the stock ran into selling pressure near the pattern’s upper trendline and 50-day moving average, which has coincided with the relative strength index falling below its neutral threshold to signal weakening price momentum.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that the 50-day MA crossed below the 200-day MA in early April to form a \"death cross,\" a chart signal that indicates further declines.\n\nLet’s point out major support and resistance levels on Apple’s chart that investors will likely be watching.\n\n**Major Support Levels to Watch**\n\nFurther weakness from current levels could see the shares initially fall to around $193. The price may encounter support near this month’s low, which closely aligns with a narrow consolidation period that formed on the chart in the back half of May last year.\n\nThe bulls’ failure to successfully defend this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $169. Investors may seek buy-and-hold entry points in this location near April's prominent low and a brief period of sideways drift before the last May’s stock gap above the 200-day MA.\n\n**Crucial Resistance Levels to Monitor**\n\nUpswings in the stock could see the price initially climb toward $215. This area may provide overhead selling pressure near a trendline that links a range of corresponding peaks and troughs on the chart stretching back to June last year.\n\nFinally, a more-bullish move in Apple shares could fuel a rally to around $237. Investors who bought at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region where notable peaks developed on the chart last July and October.",

        "selftext": "Apple's recent AI integration using OpenAI has been making waves, but many think they're late to the party. I'm wondering if there's more to their strategy than meets the eye. Are they truly behind, or is this a calculated move we're not seeing as consumers?\n\nLet's look at Apple's history:\n\n1. iPhones: Used Samsung processors for models 1-3, then switched to in-house A-series chips from iPhone 4 onward.\n2. Macs: Relied on Intel from 2006-2020, now transitioning to their own M-series (Apple Silicon).\n\nMy theory? Apple's following a familiar playbook:\n\n1. Integrate existing AI tech (OpenAI)\n2. Develop in-house models in parallel\n3. Eventually phase out external AI for proprietary solutions\n\nThese in-house AI models would likely be optimized for Apple's custom chips, just like their current software. This could give them a significant edge in performance and efficiency.\n\nApple's success often comes from perfecting technologies rather than being first. They've shown they can dominate markets they enter late (smartphones, tablets, smartwatches).\n\nWhat do you think? Will Apple stick to this pattern for AI, or will they continue relying on external providers? How might this impact $AAPL's long-term value?\n\nEager to hear your thoughts!",

I gathered information from Macrotrends, which has earnings report dating back to early 2009. For most cases that was sufficient: only Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet generated meaningful earnings before then, and it still made up a relatively small protion in nominal terms. (Sources: [Apple](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/net-income), [Microsoft](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/net-income), [Alphabet](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/net-income), [Meta](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/META/meta-platforms/net-income), [Amazon](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/net-income), [Nvidia](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/net-income), [Broadcom](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AVGO/broadcom/net-income), [Tesla](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/net-income))\n\nA couple things to note:\n- Since Nvidia and Broadcom have yet to report for the quarter, I estimated net income based on consensus EPS. This likely underestimates since they reliably beat estimates (especially Nvidia).\n- I plotted all the companies on the same vertical scale so that we could directly compare differences in their earnings.\n- At $34.4B (likely generous since it excludes much of the early period when Tesla was not profitable), Tesla has generated less cumulative net income than Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia did in the last two quarters alone. I knew about the first three, but not the latter three. Moreover, it less net income in its entire corporate lifespan than Apple did **in last quarter alone**, in what was generally viewed as a disappointing quarter for Apple.\n- The lead with which Apple has over the rest of the field is remarkable, although the overall trend appears flat. But I didn't appreciate the very strong seasonal trend with each release cycle leading into the holiday season.\n- Alphabet actually takes the lead for the last year, topping $100 billion in net income.\n- I was surprised to learn that despite a late start, Meta has actually made more money cumulatively than Amazon.\n",

        "selftext": "First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from May. 16 to May. 23. \n\nMidweek, the main focus was 30-year Treasury yield. By the end of the week, Trump took center stage with a proposal for 50% tariff on European Union starting June 1. While Scott Bessent provided some optimism, Fed's Goolsbee added a dose of negative. Let's take a look at the current positions.\n\nHere are the S&P 500's week-by-week results,\n\nMar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Apr. 4 close at 5,074.08 🔴\n\nApr. 4 close at 5,074.08 - Apr. 11 close at 5,358.75 🟢\n\nApr. 11 close at 5,358.75 - Apr. 25 close at 5,523.52 🟢\n\nApr. 25 close at 5,358.75 - May. 2 close at 5,686.67 🟢\n\nMay. 2 close at 5,686.67 - May. 9 close at 5,659.91 🔴\n\nMay. 9 close at 5,659.91 - May. 16 close at 5,957.63 🟢 (+5.26%)\n\nMay. 16 close at 5,957.63 - May. 23 close at 5,802.82 🔴 (-2.59%)\n\nDay-by-Day Standouts;\n\n🔸 Monday: Last week ended very well with the S&P 500 gained more than 5%. This week started with downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Moody's and causing indexes open more than 1% lower. Despite the initial panic, markets recovered during the session and closed slightly higher. 🟢\n\n🔸 Tuesday: After a strong recovery on Monday, the indexes opened flat on Tuesday. The market began to focus on the 30-year Treasury yield. It was a quiet session and the S&P 500 closed slightly lower. Meanwhile, investors turned to gold as a safe haven and pushing price up around 2% to $3,300. 🔴\n\n🔸 Wednesday: Before the session, CNN reported that Israel may attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Gold prices rose again and passed $3,300. The stock market opened lower around 0.5% due to both 30-year Treasury yield and Israel attack. During the session, 30-year Treasury yield continued upper trend and back above 5.05%. It's highest level since October 2023. The stock market closed lower more than 1.5%. This is also the worst close so far in May. 🔴\n\n🔸 Thursday: After 2-day losing streak, the stock market opened flat. The 30-year Treasury yield hit 5.15% before easing. The House of Representatives passed Trump’s tax and spending bill. As a result, the S&P 500 closed slightly negative and down just 0.04% while the Nasdaq finished higher. 🔴\n\n🔸 Friday: Yesterday was a busy day. Before the session, Trump proposed a 50% tariff on European Union starting June 1. The future market reacted immediately and dropping more than 1%. He also stated that Apple should move production to the U.S. and he can add 25% tariff on them. The stock market opened lower more than 1%. During the session, Scott Bessent offered some optimism. He said several large trade deals will be announced in the next couple of weeks and the U.S. will resume in-person negotiations with China. This helped the market recover slightly, but the S&P 500 still closed lower more than 0.5% and extending losing streak to 4-day. Additionally, Fed's Goolsbee said that rate cuts are still possible in next 10-16 months due to uncertainty in trade policy. As of now, the stock market expects the earlist in September. 🔴\n\nTrump has remained silent on tariffs for a week and the stock market has been trending upward. On April 7, the S&P 500 hit the lowest level at 4,835.04 and then it had climbed at 5,968.61 on May 19. It gained over 20% in just a month. Despite recent volatility, the stock market hasn't dropped significantly. Could this mean it's still looking to forward? What do you think? And how was your week?\n\n❓ Note: Many people have asked where screenshots come from in my previous posts. I'm using Stock+ on iPhone and iPad. You can find it on the App Store.

Many car parts, electronic components and other big-ticket consumer items are manufactured in China, for example, which currently faces a 145% total tariff rate on goods imported to the United States.\n\n[Trump’s tariffs on a bevy of other countries](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariffs-us-businesses-are-angry-worried-about-survival-price-hikes.html) are currently in the middle of a 90-day pause, with a 10% baseline tariff rate instead applying to all imported goods across the board. The pause is due to expire on July 9, with [Trump touting a series of rate negotiations](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/09/trump-announces-90-day-tariff-pause-for-at-least-some-countries.html) with foreign leaders between now and then.\n\n“We don’t know, 90 days from now, when they’ve revisited the tariffs, we don’t know how big they’re going to be,” Goolsbee said.\n\nSome U.S. business owners who buy goods manufactured in China say they already can’t afford to place rush orders on inventory. Matt Rollens, owner and CEO of Granite Bay, California-based novelty drinkware company Dragon Glassware, [says he’s temporarily holding his products in China](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/ceo-trump-china-tariffs-are-doomsday-scenario-for-small-businesses.html) because paying the 145% levy would force him to raise consumer prices by at least 50%, likely drying up customer demand.\n\nRollens has enough inventory in the U.S. to last roughly until June, and hopes the tariffs will be rolled back by then, he told CNBC Make It on April 11.\n\nShort-term uncertainty and financial pain aside, the Fed’s Goolsbee expressed optimism about the country’s longer-term economic outlook.\n\n“If we can get through this, it’s important to remember: The hard data coming into April was pretty good. The unemployment rate \\[was\\] around steady full employment, inflation \\[was\\] coming down,” he said. “It’s just a desire of people expressing they don’t want to back to ’21 and ’22, at a time when inflation was really raging out of control.”",

Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.\n\nA U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.\n\nAfter markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.\n\n# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report\n\nWednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.\n\nTrump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.\n\n# This Week’s Calendar\n\n**Monday, June 9**\n\n* Wholesale inventories (April)\n* Apple’s (AAPL) WWDC conference begins with CEO Tim Cook's keynote address and special event\n* Key Earnings: Casey’s General Stores (CASY)\n\n**Tuesday, June 10**\n\n* NFIB Small Business Optimism Index (May)\n* Key Earnings: J.M.

That highlighted the way the Trump administration’s tariffs campaign — peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods — is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.\n\nInvestors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.’s artificial intelligence chips.\n\nLast year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.\n\nThe value of phone component exports to India — home to Apple’s biggest iPhone production base outside of China — roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.\n\nApple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home. The device has never been produced in the US, a project that appears unfeasible at least in the short run.",

The iPhone 16 would climb to $959 from $799.\n\nHere is what the major phone carriers said this week as they reported earnings about the potential for tariff-driven price increases on consumers.\n\n# Verizon ([VZ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VZ)) CEO Hans Vestberg:\n\n\"In general, if the tariff is going to be as high as they say on the handsets, we are not planning to cover that in our work,\" Vestberg said. \"That's just not going to be possible. So, we will continue to be financially disciplined in whatever promotions we have, but we will not cover any enormous increase on tariffs on handsets. That's ultimately going to hit the consumer in the market. But again, it's too early to say. We don't know where tariff is going to go.\"\n\n# AT&T ([T](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/T)) CEO John Stankey:\n\n\"So if tariffs are the next driver of an increase in the unit cost of handsets, I imagine we're going to have to go through the exact same play, which is, first of all, understand what the customer needs and then make some adjustments to how we support them in that process,\" Stankey said. \"But that process is going to be taking that cost as we've traditionally done and largely moving it through to the end user and fitting it into the business model of ultimately what we can afford to drive the right level of returns in our business. And I think we've demonstrated over time that we've done that fairly effectively.\"\n\n# T-Mobile ([TMUS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TMUS)) CEO Mike Sievert to [Yahoo Finance ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-ceo-tariffs-on-phones-will-have-to-be-eaten-by-consumers-231011987.html)(video above):\n\n\"Tariffs are unpredictable at this point,\" Sievert said. \"Obviously, we're watching closely. If they come in and they're significant in some way, that's going to have to be borne by the customer. I mean, our model isn't prepared for something like that.\"\n\nSievert added, \"I think what would happen is prices will rise for smartphones, and then people will slow down their purchases of smartphones, and upgrade rates will slow. Those would be the dynamics that would happen. We don't see that that is on the way.\"",

China is the next \"catalyst\" I'm waiting on.\n\n[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\\- (This is unrelated to tariffs overall) The underlying holdings are starting to get close to the cost basis they have- their average cost is around $67.5K, and it's currently trading at $80K- at that point we may see something trade closer to NAV.

Raised full-year product revenue guidance to $4.33B vs. $4.29B exp. Q2 product revenue guidance of $1.035B–$1.045B implies \\~25% growth from some random SA article I read. Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cg9nyo1jyb2f1.png?width=1015&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9f7d81b9ccabc84c9d6c3c66d901b8bf226e777\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\-OpenAI announced the acquisition of Jony Ive's AI hardware startup for $6.4B. This is the first shot in what I consider the \"AI Consumer Hardware War\" (sorry Humane Pin, you don't count lol). This positions OpenAI to develop a new generation of AI-powered devices and could challenge Apple in the AI space. Stock fell intraday yesterday 2-3%, interested to see if we continue that selloff. Watching the 200 level as well. Apple has essentially fallen flat with AI (Apple Intelligence) and hasn't struck gold recently with any good hardware, we can safely consider the Apple Vision a bust.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60k9lywhyb2f1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=329f07161d7e65f98527f9a30defb4f8f403311d\n\n[**FICO (FICO)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FICO&p=d)\\-FHFA director William J.

The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krnbuzkgyb2f1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fad200de4c704853f6a81c8caf2e33a0ac51830\n\n[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\-The stock has been on a monster run, and I'm interested in the short today.

Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.\n\nContext: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.\n\nRisks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in SouthEast Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.\n\nRelated Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks.\n\nOffhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META)\n\nTicker: ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dh5rkli99cge1.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=acb81ac92f0567332dd437609f2551796713215d\n\nCatalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.\n\nIt leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.\n\nKerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.\n\nThe report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.\n\nContext: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.\n\nSector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.\n\nKerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.\n\nChina's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.\n\nRisks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now.\n\nHowever, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result.\n\nThere are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.\n\nRelated Tickers: LRCX, AMAT, KLAC\n\nTicker: INTC\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ug6evzz99cge1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec9e7355a1ce06f1b75734263d3e5454c61ee31\n\nCatalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.\n\nContext: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.\n\nIntel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.\n\nRisks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.\n\nRelated Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM\n\nTicker: ASTS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvcyyufa9cge1.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=a65d27f263bff96fbbd2dd41abca36e0d42a073a\n\nCatalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.\n\nContext: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024,\n\nwhether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.\n\nSector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.\n\nRisks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.\n\nRelated Tickers: T/VZ/RKLB",

Approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comes from China. Interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there. The newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. AAPL is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ydeuzzjeitse1.png?width=1540&format=png&auto=webp&s=e49f1a506cc948bf35b750a2a4229c69d86b8308\n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \\~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades.

AAPL, MSFT and NVDA are already 50% of IUIT so I don’t think that I need more of them but I’m planning to put 5% in GOOGL and AMZN each.\n\nGSAT and ASTS are companies that I think have the technology of the future. They’ve also got big investments by big companies and I think that Apple and Verizon know what they’re doing so I’m planning to put 5% in GSAT and ASTS each as well.\n\nRest will go to VUSA and maybe a smaller part in IUIT.\n\nMy question is am I too tech heavy for my age and when is person to tech heavy?\n\nAnd what are some good ETF for diversification?\n\n",

AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices.

This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips- it pushes companies to be more incentivized to rent for the short term.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29i57yvsdmse1.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd68618f5cf96b46c2325e6b14ff787ccc40504\n\n[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected.

The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the \"worst housing market in almost 50 years.\" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hakavz1vdmse1.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=652b31ff9c21aad705a4e6ebda02d2e3540a0a37\n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to \"Liberation Day\" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off.

Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\\~$55.20).

        "title": "WSJ—Trump’s Economic Messaging is Spooking Some of His Own Advisers👀",
        "selftext": "WSJ—President Trump’s stop-and-start trade policy and uneven economic messaging have rattled some of his own allies, triggering a flood of calls from business executives, concerns from Republican lawmakers and tension in the White House.\n\nSenior officials, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, have received panicked calls from chief executives and lobbyists, who have urged the administration to calm jittery markets by outlining a more predictable tariff agenda, according to people familiar with the discussions. Many in the business community have abandoned efforts to get the president to reverse course on trade, instead pleading with the White House for clarity on his approach, the people said. \n\nIn a meeting Monday in the White House’s Roosevelt Room, the president and his top advisers huddled with the chief executive officers of International Business Machines, Qualcomm, HP and other tech companies. Some of the CEOs voiced their concerns about Trump’s tariffs, warning that they could hurt their industry, according to a person who attended the meeting. Trump told reporters that attendees at the meeting talked about investing in the U.S.\n\nThe mixed messages from the president and his advisers have raised concerns among some Republicans that Trump lacks a cohesive economic plan. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week the economy needed a “detox.” Trump has acknowledged that the tariffs could result in economic pain for consumers and, in an interview Sunday, declined to rule out a recession, accelerating a selloff on Wall Street on Monday that wiped out all gains in major stock indexes since Election Day in November. On Tuesday, the president played down the possibility of a recession, but underscored his commitment to far-reaching tariffs. \n\nAll the while, Trump and his team have made frequent adjustments to his trade policies, announcing last-minute exemptions and reversals.\n\n“It has been a horrific start for the economic policy team,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director who now runs the conservative American Action Forum.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to tariffs has unnerved some Trump administration economic officials, including staff on the National Economic Council, who are concerned that tariffs and uncertainty over trade policy are tanking the stock market and fueling price increases on everything from energy to construction materials, people familiar with the matter said. The president’s economic advisers have warned him that tariffs could hurt the market and economic growth, but he has largely been undeterred, the people said. \n\nThe White House said Trump’s economic advisers aren’t divided. “Every member of the Trump administration is playing from the same playbook—President Trump’s playbook—to enact an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said. \n\nDesai confirmed that senior officials have taken calls from corporate leaders, adding that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has talked to nearly a dozen CEOs in the past two days.\n\nThe spate of tariff proclamations and the resulting economic convulsions have brought to the surface long-simmering tensions among members of Trump’s economic team.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the hard-charging former chief executive at the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, is overseeing Trump’s expansive trade agenda and has regularly appeared on cable television to discuss the matter. He has at times not fully looped in some of the president’s other economic advisers, according to people familiar with the matter, including Hassett, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and officials at the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nIn one instance last week, Lutnick went on Fox News and announced that Canada and Mexico could soon strike a deal with the U.S. to avoid some of the 25% tariffs Trump had imposed over fentanyl trafficking. That surprised Greer and CEA staff, leaving them rushing to come up with a solution, eventually persuading Trump to grant a one-month pause on tariffs for goods that comply with a U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBessent has made clear to members of Trump’s team that he wants to be a principal voice on economic policy across the administration, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n“Secretary Lutnick’s long and immensely successful private sector career makes him an integral addition to the Trump administration’s trade and economic team,” Desai said, pointing to manufacturing job gains and investment commitments from companies such as Apple   and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  \n\nOn CBS News on Tuesday night, Lutnick defended the administration’s rollout of its trade policy, saying: “It is not chaotic, and the only one who thinks it’s chaotic is someone who’s being silly.”\n\nNearly two months into Trump’s presidency, his advisers say he is more determined than ever to carry out his far-reaching tariff agenda, despite increasing pressure to change course. \n\nIn Trump’s first term, he watched the markets almost hourly, and even a temporary dip could lead to a change in policy, former senior administration officials said. This time, he is still interested in the markets, but is less inclined to abandon his tariff plans, though he has delayed the implementation of some duties, an administration official said. \n\nTrump’s first-term National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, and others at times opposed the president’s tariff proposals. This time, most of Trump’s current advisers aren’t trying to dissuade him from invoking tariffs, officials said. Instead, they are advocating for more targeted tariffs with exemptions for key sectors. \n\nFor example, Hassett and others successfully lobbied Trump to abandon his campaign pledge for an across-the-board tariff on all U.S. trading partners, and to opt instead for a reciprocal trade action that would allow room for other nations to negotiate lower tariffs with the U.S., according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nTrump’s reciprocal tariff move, which seeks to equalize U.S. tariffs with the duties and nontariff barriers charged by other nations, is set to be announced in April. But that initiative could take six months or more to implement fully, people familiar with the policy previously told The Wall Street Journal. \n\nThe uncertainty over tariff policy is also frustrating some Trump allies on Capitol Hill, a growing number of whom are worried about the economic ramifications of tariffs.\n\n“We don’t know what this is gonna look like tomorrow,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.), adding that he is “very frustrated” by the uncertainty that the tariff agenda is foisting on farmers and businesses in his state. \n\nRepublican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said the stop-and-start nature of the tariffs is contributing to stock market losses and difficulties in corporate planning. “Business hates uncertainty,” he said.\n\nSen. Bill Hagerty (R., Tenn.), a Trump confidant and a first-term ambassador to Japan, acknowledged that the markets are “trying to digest” the messages emanating from the White House on tariffs, but held out hope that certainty could be on the horizon.\n\n“I think once we get these [tariff] announcements done and the market can actually sort out exactly what they mean, that will hopefully calm things,” he said.\n\nTrump spoke Tuesday to the Business Roundtable, an influential group of corporate executives. A person familiar with the event’s planning said several executives changed their plans to attend.\n\n“Swinging from one extreme to another is not the right policy approach,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told an energy conference in Houston on Monday. “We have allocated capital that’s out there for decades, and so we really need consistent and durable policy.”\n",

        "selftext": "LAST MINUTE OPTION PLAYS FOR AAPL EARNINGS AND BEYOND\n\n \n\nContinuing our eventful week of earnings and government reports, another great opportunity for investors comes from Apple. Personally, it is so difficult to tell which way the underlying will move, as Apple is one of the strongest and best companies in the world(heck just about everyone I know has at least some type of Apple product), but with economic uncertainty in the US and risk of costs drastically rising from tariffs, its impossible to know what will happen. That being said, we still came up with the best options strategies for whichever way it moves, and this could be the opportunity YOU have been looking for.\n\nOur goals were to limit downside risk, maximize potential profits(duh), and be in the money as soon as possible, rather than finding a trade that is only profitable near expiration. On this note, for you bulls out there, the first trade we found is a 250/270 Call Spread, expiring in June\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29lfp9wvd7ye1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5ad8032fb1911455083281c0ba40d582843641e\n\nThe cost of this trade is slightly higher than average over the past two years, but well cheaper than it’s been over the past month and a half, which I believe gives it quite good value\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/opkhip3xd7ye1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=c00260cd72d206184bb86899e4b947069dbe2b8d\n\nSimilarly to many of the leading US equities, the cost of the underlying is high compared to the past couple years, but also well below its recent February high. The implications of this are for each investor to determine themselves, but there is a case to be made for movement in either direction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itki5a9yd7ye1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5f7857e65314e158b8996c473f8592790150b5\n\nThe heatmap of this trade shows the profitability probabilities, and we like this trade because it profits immediately on a positive movement in the underlying, while limiting downside risk to the cost of the premium only, making it a safe trade with the chance for very strong returns.\n\n\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pntbuqwzd7ye1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=c144f3ad663a7b675e6db96a7177d9ed8b2cee12\n\nOn this flip side, for you bears out there looking to profit on a downward move, we found a 185/165 Put Spread, also expiring in June\n\n\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvab5uy0e7ye1.png?width=3035&format=png&auto=webp&s=860af779a14bb5d7dfacbeecfc6c8aaf05f71ecb\n\nThe cost of this trade is similar top the positive one, in the sense that it is slightly higher than it was historically, but also cheaper than it’s been over the past few weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0prq7ra2e7ye1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=6afa7f8ad836f4b9496ed81b2507c0885fa9682a\n\nThe heatmap of this trade shows the strong profitability of this trade, showing how it profits immediately upon a downward move of the underlying, while at the same showing how risk is limited to the cost of the premium, giving it a high return chance with minimal negative risk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grhbdi85e7ye1.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9975e124b91f9fb972e1e03fc59a0eb58af04c6\n\nIn conclusion, this is a time of uncertainty in the US and global markets. This creates opportunities for investors to capitalize on volatility and make serious money. While I do not have a crystal ball and cannot say which direction AAPL or any stock will move, we can and do provide the best trades to make for each side and leave it up to you.\n\n \n\nAnd remember, at the end of the day, it’s better to be lucky than good, so good luck to you all.",

        "selftext": "I've been logging my progress using double calendars each week on the sub. This week I was profitable on every company I played for earning's (ON, Meta, Amzn, Aapl, Dkng). This is not an accident or luck, it's becoming increasingly more consistent as gain more experience with double calendars.\n\nI'm just a hair from 30% on the year, the market has experienced its worst drawdown and am totally unexposed and still profiting it's an amazing and beautiful thing to see.\n\n* Three weeks ago was very profitable with NFLX $650/$715 double calendar and TSM $165/$185/$205 triple calendar. However, bought NVDA shares impulsively at the top, options gains covered the losses cutting even. Vowed to never have undefined risk again. Only traded options since, no shares anymore and won't buy shares unless it's an ETF. Am ready to go deep on SMH after see fear and greed index tank to 20's.\n* Two weeks ago was profitable on 3/4 companies played through earning's. Made post detailing the mistake made, bought triple calendar $170 (1), $185 (3), $200 (4) on Google but did not create a neutral structure. There was not enough downside protection, only had (1) put calendar compared to (4) calendars OTM and (3) ATM. Vowed to always play the market neutrally and prepare equally for the downside always.\n\nThis week was profitable on every company or 5/5, last week going 3/4 with the Google mistake being something recognized early, but didn't correct and would've been very profitable going 4/4 had bought more put calendars and offset the ATM and OTM call calendars.\n\nThis week played (ON $64/$76), (Meta $455/$510), (Apple $205/$217.5/$230), (Amzn $165/$180/$195), (Dkng $32/$40)\n\nMost of the contracts like to close before earning's to secure profit, offset the cost/risk of what I do hold through earning's. I also use the ATM calendar as the new bottom or top if price has moved too aggressively. For example, I had meta $400/$455/$500 originally but the price over few days ran from $455 to $475. So right before earning's I closed the $400/$500. I used the $455 as the floor, opening the $510 as the new top so $455/$510 instead to carry through earning's. Have to adapt.\n\nImo nobody can become consistently profitable without playing to the upside and downside, this is why neutral structures like double calendars are so effective, more-so during earning's when high IV environment gives massive premiums offsetting the cost of the calls/puts so playing direction on a mulligan. The ultimate Theta play imo.\n\n(Next week have LLY $730/$795/$870, DDOG $90/$125, ELF $135/$185,  - Need companies to report later in the week so can close before earning's, right before expiration, giving Theta time to burn up to the last moment possible, giving the market no time to react to earning's; the following days always dangerous. For example, Meta much harder to play than Amazon, difference of reporting Wednesday close vs. Thursday close. If wanted to be a gambler could hold all my contracts through earning's. but I want to sell and keep what I hold through basically for free from the profit of closing before, which really has cost me profit but am more concerned about averting risk.)",

        "title": "Technical Indicators to Detect Short-Term Price Increases for Options Trading",
        "selftext": "**Note: This is an updated version of a previous post that was removed as it wasn't sufficiently related to options trading; Mods, please let me know if this post is still not adequate**\n\nHello all!\n\nI'm posting here again relating to technique I've started using which I'm hoping will be rather profitable in options trading. The technique I use relies on 3 technical indicators to predict short-term (12 - 24 hours post-signal) increases in the market; while the increases can vary considerably, you can consistently rely on a $1 - $2 jump in the price for most liquid stocks (that are above $100/share), which should be able to generate a profit a good chunk of the time.\n\n# The Strategy\n\nThe technical indicators (and filters) I rely on are:\n\n* **200 MA**: The price must be above the 200 MA\n* **Stochastic RSI**: A built in indicator on tradingview where sub-20 indicates oversold conditions; two conditions must be met here\n   * The indicator (K) must dip below 20 at some point\n   * The difference between the fast (K) and the slow (D) must be greater than or equal to 5\n* **The Ensemble Technical Indicator** **(ETI)**: The ETI is an indicator I created (which is available on Tradingview) which converts numerous technical indicators into 1 or -1 (based on whether the trend is bullish or bearish for that specific indicator), sums these numbers up and then sums across the previous 20 value to generate a singular value. Here values under -40 indicate oversold while those over 50 indicate overbought. For more details relating to this indicator, you can refer to a post I made in the technical indicator subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalanalysis/comments/1fc1kln/the_ensemble_technical_indicator_a_new_technical/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The indicator must dip at or below -40 for this strategy.\n\nSo, to summarize, for a buy signal the price has to be **above** the 200 MA, with the Stochastic RSI **dipping below** 20 **while** the ETI is at-40 or below, **and** the difference between the K and D metrics of the Stochastic RSI must be **5 or more**.\n\nThat's a mouthful! But it's quite easy to spot on a chart (I chose AMZN as I'm monitoring the chart right now), which I've pasted below. The candles are at the 4 hour level as this (and the 1D) level tends to have a higher success rate than lower timeframes (1 hr can also be used for more frequent signals)\n\n[AMZN chart on Tradingview](https://preview.redd.it/h4xh4is7elde1.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=54db642ff824c00f8145e77d8bb97f086667044b)\n\nSo we can see that on Monday November 25th at 9:30a, all our criteria have been satisfied:\n\n* Price is above 200MA\n* ETI is at/below -40 (-44)\n* Stoch RSI has dipped below 20 while ETI is at/below -40\n* The difference between the K (blue line) and D (orange line) is equal to or greater than 5 (6.59)\n\nAs such we would buy an ATM option at the next open ($201.90).\n\nThere can be some slightly ambiguous circumstances, which IMO fulfil the criteria I laid out, but are not as obvious. For instance, below we see the difference between the K & D is greater than 5, but the K is above 20. Again, the K simply has to dip below 20 while the ETI is at/below -40, so this in my mind is still a buy signal\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjv8clhuelde1.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=276d1c9fa81689745eb5dc9489a31c10b97a7fb7\n\n# Success Rate\n\nWhat does the success rate look like using this strategy? I ran a backtest using 4 hour candles from Tradingview, using the above parameters for SPY, NVDA, GOOG, AMZN, APPL & TSLA given these stocks tend to have the most liquid options. I also only included signals where the stock price (at its high) was at least $100.\n\nData went back as far as 2004 depending on the stock and when it crossed the $100 level (e.g. SPY) and a total of 175 instances were identified. When a buy signal was generated the average maximum dollar jump in the following three candles was $3.44 (vs. $2.62 when the above filters are not applied; a statistically significant difference).\n\nIn terms of thresholds, if you're looking to sell when the stock increases by $1 from the opening price of the candle following the buy signal, that occurs 69% of the time (vs. 62% of the time when the price is above $100 without the additional filters).\n\nThe results also vary by stock as seen in the table below. We can see that with the exception of AAPL and TSLA, the strategy is better than random chance at identifying at least $1 increases in the stock price in the 3 bars (12ish hours) from the buy signal.\n\n|Ticker|Less than $1 Increase|$1 Increase or greater|% Strategy|% Chance|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AAPL|10|15|60%|72%|\n|AMZN|2|23|92%|72%|\n|GOOG|2|7|78%|67%|\n|NVDA|1|6|86%|77%|\n|SPY|29|46|61%|50%|\n|TSLA|8|21|72%|88%|\n\n# Strategy for Option Trading\n\nNow that I've explained the strategy, how does it work for option trading? when I see that a signal is about to be generated, I look to buy:\n\n* ATM options with a delta of at least 0.4\n* a DTE that allows me to make a profit with a $1 increase over 2 days.\n* Once I hit my $1 increase I either sell, or set a stop-loss (acknowledging those don't always work) so I can further profit as the price goes up (remember the average increase is $3.44 with the median being $1.82 - meaning that 50% of max increases are above $1.82).\n* If $1 increase doesn't hit I exit at the close of the 3rd bar (for the 4H candles; exit at the end of the 2nd bar for 1D candles)\n\nI've already started using this strategy over the past 3 or 4 days using candles at the 4H and 1D level and have made a small profit winning 5/6 trades (the last one hit the $1 increase, but i wasn't fast enough to sell).\n\nIssues with this strategy include that when you have to buy options at the bell, the volatility can mean you get less than favourable prices given how difficult it can be to time a good buy at the bell. Additionally, while this strategy at the 1D candle works 81% of the time (i.e. 81% of the time the price will increase at least $1 over 2 days) for stocks currently in the S&P 500, this is not much better than chance (78%).\n\nI would look to hear people's feedback, thoughts, criticisms, etc.",

        "title": "Iron Condor Help (Happy Friday)",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone! Happy Friday!\n\nI wanted to come here and talk about some experience that I have had over the past couple of days for Iron Condors. I am looking to use statistics to find prices on short dated options and collect credit. I am using paper trading on Thinkorswim, while I get the hang of it and track some of the winners, losers, and fine tune my strategy. \n\nI currently use the Bollinger bands to look at standard deviation. I am trying to target companies that are large or mega cap stocks that have lots of option volume for short dated options. I know the longer out on the expiration that you go, the harder it is to fill a condor, given it has 4 legs, however you can get better spreads. I am also using RSI, and other technical indicators to find price levels (support and resistance). I am not one to try to find narrow ranges that the stock could fall on, I want to prioritize the win rate of this strategy over the total profit per trade. My thinking is that if I can win 95% of the trades, by hitting a bunch of singles (baseball reference), it is better than a homerun while taking more risk. \n\nLike I said, I am paper trading my account, and so far over the last two days, I have had to close out some legs on the condors due to heightened volatility among the mag 7 stocks. This is one of the main reasons that I am trying not to do this with real money until I get the hang of it. Despite those set backs, I have still done fairly well over a two day trial period. I intend on paper trading for several months and tracking my trades to see what works, and get a better idea of my win rates, etc. \n\nHere were some of the trades that went well for me that I opened yesterday and today. \n\nDAL (Opened on 9/5) Expiration 9/6/2024:   \nBought Put @ 40.50 strike for .05, Sold One Put @ 41.00 strike for .07. Total credit = $2 per contract.  \nSold One Call @ 44 strike for .09, Bought one call @ 44.50 strike for .05. Total Credit = $$4 per contract. \n\nTotal credit was $6 per condor and I conducted 100 condors, collecting a total credit of $600. As of close today, I was able to make my max profit. My thinking with this trade was that with the airline news yesterday, there was heightened volatility, which shot IV on this option chain up significantly, so I was able to make some money by selling a condor. I pulled up my technical analysis tools, and found the upper and lower bounds to determine where my sold calls and puts should be. Despite the profits being low relative to the max loss, I thought it was a very safe trade. Please let me know your thoughts on this, looking for feedback and a way to learn more about the condors and other strategies!\n\nAAPL (Opened 9/6) Expiration 9/6/2024:  \nBought put @ 215 strike for .05, sold one put @ 217.50 strike .15. Total credit = $10 per contract  \nSold one call @ 227.50 strike for .03, bought one call @ 230 strike for .02. Total credit = $1 per contract. \n\nTotal credit collected was $11 per condor, and like DAL, I opened 100 condors, for a total collected premium of $1100. My thinking here is that Apple is likely to trade within the range, and is less correlated and volatile to NVDA, AVGO, and other chip companies. I spotted this trade last night while looking around for opportunities at the open. Used my technical indicators the same as with the DAL. The lower IV, and a bearish bias on the stock (given the wider spreads on the put side of the condor), enabled me to collect a little more premium, however, the difference in strike prices ramped up my max loss more than the DAL trade. \n\nI had a bunch of other trades, but those are just to serve as an example. To save time I will not include all of them. But on another note...\n\nWhat are the ways you guys currently look to set up your condors? How are you looking for entries? What screeners do you use to find stocks that are trading sideways? What times are best for condors? What is your experience with condors? What are some other strategies that I should look at that have a neutral outlook on a stock? What options can I layer on top of a condor to increase credit, or lower the risk profile if the stock really moves against you? Perhaps there is a way to trade a condor around earnings to capitalize on high volatility, but also buy upside and downside protection if the stock really moves one way or another (think of a situation like AVGO today)?   \n  \nThanks in advance for all of the info everyone, talk to you in the comments!

My goal with this post is to share my experience so that others can learn.   : )\n\nMy lesson learned is avoid *tunnel vision*.  In my case, I was doing a 0dte OTM call on $AAPL yesterday. \n\nReason I chose $AAPL as my stock of choice; I prefer options that are within my price range and especially if I’ve traded the stock before. \n\nMy inherent mistakes before my big OOF: I didn’t check the news, didn’t check the indexes/ overall market conditions. \n\nWhat I did right: I got setup during premarket and did **technical analysis** on a handful of things before choosing $AAPL. \n\nSo - how did I F this up:  right before market open, I saw that $AAPL was extremely oversold in per RSI indicator - like extremely oversold at 18.  So right then I knew that the *RSI should rebound*.  I was correct about the rebound.\n\nHowever, I failed to take note of the overall trend from premarket into open - the 200 EMA clearly showed a bearish day for $AAPL (and the other tech giants).  I’ve got the 200 EMA on everything, I just tunnel visioned in the RSI without zooming out for a sec. \n\nI bought my OTM calls at the lowest RSI dip, expecting the price to rebound - NOPE! The price kept falling and falling . . . Until about noon, but by then my position was down.  I kept watching until expiry only for my loss to realize.\n\nSo learn from me: NEVER TUNNEL VISION!!! \n\nI’ve got to regrow my cash account with $5 lol. But I look forward to the adventure and learning. ",

        "selftext": "I understand the basic concept of Calls and Puts.  Calls you are betting that the underlying stock is going to go up.  Puts you are shorting or betting that a stock is going to go down in price.  To a small degree, I understand the Strike Price.  To me, I understand it as your entry point into the market.  Let's say AAPL is $5.00 per share.  I want to make a Call that it is going up 2 dollars.  I make a strike price of $7.00.  This is where things gets complicated.  If I select $7.00 on an app like Robinhood or WeBull there's a break-even point. I did not pay attention to this until I decided I was losing too much money.  Turns out, as majority of you already know, I made OTM (Out of the money) calls.  Lower % chance of making money, but when you are right you make more money if your goal is met fast.  If I chose a $6.00 call I'm more likely ATM (At the money).  Not as high of a bet, but you can still make good money and it is less of a hurdle to make money with the right volatility, Delta, and IV (Implied Volatility). Now, ITM (In the money) has the higher chance of making money, but not necessarily the highest amount of money that can be made compared to OTM (if OTM is correct).  \n\nThis is where I get a little confused.  I understand Calls better than Puts.  My strike price I'm saying I want to have the right to purchase 100 of these shares at $ X.XX price.  Regardless, if the price hits $10.00 in a day. If you exercise Call contract, you can purchase 100 of those shares at the price of $5, $6, or $7 instead of buying 100 shares at the price of $10.00 dollars.  Makes sense to me, please correct me if I'm wrong on this.  \n\nPuts are confusing to me.  Can I lose money if the stock market goes down way too fast? Example, I make a strike price that AAPL is going to go down the next day from $10 to $8. In this scenario though, let's say the stock market crashes and AAPL goes to $2.00.  Do I lose money? Why would anyone want to buy my Put contract if they can just buy 100 shares at the $2.00 current price versus buying my Put contract that gives me the right to enter the market at $8? Would I have to hope that the price is going to rebound and appear that it is going to go past $8 dollars again? \n\n  \nSorry no TL;DR. ",

        "title": "Mastering the Wheel Strategy",
        "selftext": "Have you always wanted to master the wheel strategy—turning it into a reliable income stream while also getting paid to potentially buy shares at a discount?\n\nToo many traders segregate puts and calls into separate bets, only to fumble when the market surprises them. Thankfully, you can use the Wheel strategy instead to harness time decay, volatility swings, and assignment mechanics in your favor.\nIn this article, we’re doing more than outlining “sell puts, then sell calls.” You’ll get a full, five-stage deep dive: the theory behind why it works, real-world examples of successes and failures, step-by-step drills to lock in each skill, and advanced pro-tips that most retail traders overlook. Let’s roll.\n\n##Why The Wheel Strategy Outperforms Stand-Alone Strategies\n\nThe Wheel strategy is a logical extension of covered calls married to cash-secured puts. Rather than hoping for a one-directional move, you systematically “rent” your capital or shares to the market. First, you sell puts on a stock you’re comfortable owning; if assigned, you then sell calls to monetize holding the shares.\n\nThis rotation accomplishes two goals: you generate immediate income through time decay and implied volatility, and you avoid speculative directional risk by defining both entry (via puts) and exit (via calls) points in advance. Studies of covered-call indexes (like the BXM) show they tend to outperform buy-and-hold over decades in total return metrics, largely because they harvest option premium consistently. The Wheel simply adds the put-selling leg to capture premium even when you aren’t long shares yet.\n\nConsider a long-only call strategy: you pay a debit and face total time decay—your position can bleed to zero if you’re even one day late. A naked put sells premium to your buyer, but carries the risk of assignment if the stock gaps down. The Wheel blends them: premium buffers both directions, assignment always recoils back into another income leg, and your only true risk is carrying shares well below your discounted cost basis.\n\n##Identify Ideal Market Regimes and Stock Characteristics\n\nNot every environment or equity makes a good Wheel candidate. The optimal scenario combines moderate implied volatility (IV rank between 30–60%), a relatively stable price channel, and robust options liquidity. When IV is too low, premiums won’t justify the risk; when IV is too high, the market is signaling potential for violent moves that can blow out leveraged positions.\n\nRange-bound markets are gold mines for the Wheel. You repeatedly sell puts near support and calls near resistance, harvesting premium each time price reverts. Historical backtests on range-bound stocks like large-cap consumer staples (e.g., KO, PG) or tech giants post-earnings (e.g., AAPL after major product cycles) show premium capture on both legs can exceed 12% annualized returns, even before dividends.\n\nCrucially, you should exclude stocks with binary event risks. Stocks with week-to-week IV rank above 70% often trade in panic mode—assignment risk spikes, and rolling becomes expensive. Instead, focus on large-cap names with daily option volume north of 1,000 contracts across relevant strikes and expirations.\n\nDeep-dive drill: Build a watchlist of 10 stocks. For each, note the current IV rank, 52-week trading range, and average daily option volume. Eliminate any that fail two of those three criteria.\n\n##Preparation: Platform Setup, Cash Management, and Journal Templates\n\nBefore your first Wheel rotation, lay the groundwork. Choose a brokerage that offers advanced options analytics—think real-time Greeks, custom chain filters, and reliable exercise/assignment notifications. Interactive Brokers, ThinkOrSwim, and Tastyworks all rank highly for pro-level tools and low commissions.\n\nNext, manage your cash: since you’re selling cash-secured puts, you must reserve 100 × strike price per contract in available buying power. Treat that reserve as off-limits for stock purchases or other trades. This discipline prevents margin calls when assignments happen. If you run multiple concurrent Wheels, tally your total put obligations in a spreadsheet tab labeled “Put Reserves.”\n\nFinally, create a rolling journal template. At minimum, each trade entry should capture: underlying, leg (put or call), strike, expiration, premium received, max loss, breakeven, and assignment date. Overlay a section where you log actual P/L and notes on execution quality or market surprises. Reviewing this journal monthly will spotlight which underlyings and strike/expiration combos yield the smoothest cycles.\n\nUse a simple Google Sheet with data validation drop-downs for underlyings and strategy legs. Add conditional formatting to flag any max-loss >1.5% of account equity.\n\n##Balance Theta Decay, Delta Probability, and IV Skew\n\na. Put leg strikes & expirations:\n- Expiration: 30–45 days out. This DTE window offers optimal annualized theta decay (~3–4% daily on premium) while keeping rolling costs manageable if you need to extend. Weeklies burn too quickly; LEAPS tie up capital for months.\n- Strike: 0.20–0.30 delta. That corresponds to a 70–80% probability of expiring worthless, balancing income with assignment likelihood.\n\nb. Call leg strikes & expirations:\n- Expiration: Mirror your put cycle or choose the next monthly expiration, whichever aligns best with your tax and capital plans.\n- Strike: 0.30–0.40 delta. Higher delta calls yield more premium but increase the chance of early assignment; lower deltas pay less but may never get exercised.\n\n\n##Precision Execution, Rolling Rules, and Assignment Management\n\nExecution quality matters. Always use limit orders to capture your target premium. If the bid stays static for 15 minutes, consider improving your price by 1–2 cents to tee up a quicker fill.\n\nRolling rules: When a put is down 50% of its original premium with >7 days to expiry, rolling can lock profits and restart the cycle. For calls, if your call leg reaches 75% of max profit, buy to close and re-sell a new call further OTM or later DTE. These thresholds aren’t arbitrary—they come from optimizing the expected value of auto-roll backtests across hundreds of historical cycles.\n\nUpon put assignment, immediately sell your calls at or near the bid to capture fresh premium. If you miss the first day, you leave tens or hundreds of dollars on the table. Conversely, if a call is about to be assigned and you want to continue owning, buy back the call and roll to the next cycle rather than forfeiting shares.\n\n**Tactical checklist:**\n\n1. Pre-market: scan open puts at 2% away from your strikes.\n\n2. Mid-day: if filled, set alerts for your new covered call leg.\n\n3. Close: review any fills and log execution quality in your journal.\n\n##Final Thoughts\n\nBy layering these five deep dives—strategy rationale, market selection, preparation, strike/expiration science, and disciplined trade management—you turn the Wheel strategy from a casual idea into a systematic income machine. Start with one contract on paper, nail down your drills, then scale up as your confidence and P/L track record grow. It’s time to make the Wheel work for you—let’s get rolling!\n",

Had to pay taxes on the 15k. Then put the 65k into SDC. DCA’d when stock fell in half and put in another 50k. SDC went bankrupt so I lost 115k. Would be nice if I could tax harvest it some how.\n\nAlso this whole time I was not putting any money into 401k or Roth. A month ago filled up my Roth for the Robinhood bonus, and will deposit another 7k in a few days. And a few days ago I finally went to my HR portal and enabled max 401k. Why it took me this long, I don’t know.\n\nAnyways, I already made every possible financial mistake, so I was just trying to make the final biggest one of all. Timing the market. That is why I let my savings ballon to 250k (even after the SDC loss) .\n\nBut I just read somewhere that selling puts of SPY is like DCA’ing plus you also get paid a premium.\n\nAs you can see, I am financially illiterate, I’ve never traded options before, although I do have a Robinhood account, and I’m smart enough to know how to have a good job that pay wells. Can someone help me walk through this?\n\nI understand that when I enter a contract to sell puts, I buy 100 shares of that stock at the current price. If the shares go up I am mandated to sell these shares at that price I bought them, and the buyer can take those shares and instantly sell them for the higher price. \n\nIf the stock goes down however, than my option expires worthless, but I don’t care because I was hoping for that to happen if my goal was to DCA into SPY. I already bought the 100 shares. I just got paid the premium for giving someone an option to speculate on them.\n\nI have a couple of questions, first when doing this option, is there a particularly security to choose? Like SPY or VOO or SPLG or just the stocks I want to invest in like, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google.\n\nFor example, I noticed SPY has a ton of dates for selling puts, whereas SPLG only has 5 possible dates, roughly 2-3 months apart.\n\nMy goal is to maximize bid price right? The lower you try to sell the put for, usually the lower the bid price. \nAlso if I try to sell a put that expires in a few days, usually the bid price is a few dollars. A month away, it goes up to $10. But two months away, it doesn’t double to $20, it goes to around $12-$14. So that is why the most optimal puts are to buy the ones that are a month away. Because you collect the premium and can choose to invest into selling more puts again more quickly (if stock went up).\n\nShould I try to care about limit order or market order?\n\nRight now I’m looking at SPY, the current price is $588.70, and there is a put for $588 on Feb 21st with a bid price of $10.21\n\nSo irregardless, I make $1,021. If stock goes down, I was planning to DCA into SPY, so now I own 100 shares. If stock goes up, someone else makes more money. Since I have 250k, I can do this trade 4 times, and at the end of February, I either have 250k plus 4k, or I have 400 shares of SPY\n\nI guess now the question becomes how do I maximize the bid price while not doing something crazy? What is the best strategy for this?\n\nPlus I kinda do still believe in timing the market a little. I feel like there might be a sharp drop around end of Jan (Trump) and then we will probably trend downwards or sideways for a year or so. I’m curious if you guys agree or disagree or what are your market predictions. I feel like recession sentiment is growing, but I don't know how that correlates to an actual recession.",

        "selftext": "Hey all, I am not new to options, as I run the wheel strategy on AAPL and NVDA and have been fairly successful. I am starting to look in to put credit spreads on SPY and a lot of what I am reading or watching on youtube talk about opening positions 45 DTE and then closing around 21 DTE. I get that this is the optimal strategy to take advantage of theta, but when I look at the positions with around .25-.3 delta on the short put, the reward/risk ratio is usually something like 1/4 or 1/5. So if you only win about 75% of the time, you would come out negative. Am I missing something about this strategy? Does it all come down to managing your positions correctly and only opening when you are seeing a bullish market?",

Long-time lurker posting from a throwaway account, but I am eager for any advice Personal Finance might have for me.\n\nA little background: my parents are retired in their mid-70s and are doing great for themselves--house and cars are paid off, all of us kids are grown and out of school/supporting ourselves, and they have enough money coming in each year from social security and their state pensions ($150k total + COLA annually) that they can basically do as they please. They are in pretty good health for their ages and are working to stay that way. All this is to say that the performance of their investments and retirement accounts are really secondary concerns, since they have more than enough in guaranteed SSI/pension income to live the lives they want--they're not currently drawing down any investments and don't plan to.\n\nMy concern: my parents were fortunate enough to invest in Apple in the early 2010s, and their Apple stock has since ballooned in value after all the stock splits etc. to the tune of ~1.5 million dollars held in a taxable brokerage, the oldest shares having a cost basis of around $15. They also have about $500k in other securities in a traditional IRA. So we're talking like 75% or more of their investments being just in Apple stock. My father wants to leave this as his legacy to me and my siblings, and is very proud of the wealth he and my mom have built.\n\nI've talked to my father about the risk of holding so much in just one company, but he doesn't want to pay the 15% capital gains taxes that would be involved in selling the stock to diversify their holdings--he thinks it is better for us to inherit the stock at the stepped up cost basis when he and my mom pass, rather than sending 15% of the gains to Uncle Sam. \n\nNone of us kids need or expect the money--and I honestly hope it won't even be an issue for many more years. But he's asked me for advice and I'm not sure what to tell him. Is there a third option besides hold / sell and pay the taxes?\n\nThank you all in advance for you time and insight!",

They also have locked my account in the past if they suspected fraudulent charges. I stopped using my debit card and switched to my apple federal credit card. \n\nSo on May 26th someone made 50 fraudulent charges each $500. I was never notified by Apple via text or phone call or email. I found out on May 27th because my credit card declined buying my daughter ice cream. I logged online and saw the long list of betmgm $500 charges coming from NJ. At the time that I called there was only $2500 posted on my credit card. I reported the fraud and they closed down my credit card account. I noticed the next morning they rolled over $20,000 of fraudulent charges. In addition to that, 5 days later there were two more fraudulent charges onto my new card totaling $1,000. I immediately called Apple and they said they were pending charges that were from the old card. They said there was nothing they could do. \n\nI asked them how long this would take to get a refund and they couldn’t give me an answer. Every time I call somebody tells me something different. I spoke to one agent who seemed very confused because she said normally in this situation a provisional credit is issued immediately. So she got in touch with someone at Velaria and they said they were not issuing me one no reason why… I was furious. \n\nI am not able to use my credit card and on top of that I was told I was responsible for the minimum payment which is almost $600. The minimum payment is more money than I even had on my credit card at the time. So I called Apple Federal fraud department one more time and the lady told me my case was processing and I should receive a refund within 12 business days. I still have not received anything. I feel this whole situation is absolutely ludicrous!! Now I have almost $22,000 on my credit card and apple Federal is not willing to do anything to help me. Has anyone had a similar situation with Apple Federal? Just wondering how everything turned out.\n\nUPDATE: I checked my bank account this morning and Apple Federal refunded the $22,000 of fraud charges to my credit card. Oh Happy Day!",

It all started about a month ago when I went to a ghetto gas station and used Apple Pay (I usually use Apple Pay for everything, so to be fair it could’ve been somewhere else) after that I started getting charges from random food places ranging from 30 dlls to 160 dlls, thankfully all declined. I’ve reported and replaced my debit card 3-4 times in a span of a month and and it’s still happening. I spoke to the fraud department at my bank and suggested I unlink Apple Pay and re link it to which I did but made no difference as I just got another notification of a charge declined. I didn’t even get a chance to activate the new debit card that I got on the mail today and they’ve already tried to use it, I’m confused as to how that’s possible.\n\nWhat can I do? Will opening a fresh account work? This is getting extremely frustrating and I’m genuinely lost as to what to do, I’ve never dealt with an issue like this. \n\nUPDATE:\nIf anyone here is going through a similar situation just call your bank and have them unlink any account/device linked to your Apple Pay, also very important is to ask them to NOT enroll your new card automatically to Apple Pay because if someone is somehow linked to your Apple Pay they will get automatic access through the new account so the cycle never ends. Only way to fix is to remove auto enrollment and to unlink any and all devices off your account. \n\nI guess it’s too soon to speak but I’m hoping this fixed it. I’ll post updates if there is any.

        "selftext": "I’m 24 and landed my dream job a year ago making 90k. I was driving my dad’s old car at first, so cost wasn’t an issue at all. But someone rear ended me and it got totaled in Jan so I had to buy a new car in Feb. I wanted something that would last and that I liked so I got a 2024 Hyundai Kona for around 25k.\n\nPaid 8k down (from the insurance payout on the wrecked car), and I pay $420 per month just for the car payment. I definitely thought I could afford it, but now one of my roommates is moving out and my rent is increasing from by about $500 per month to roughly $2k per month, for the next 9ish months.\n\nNow my car payment and car insurance payment are a little over $600 per month in total, and my take home pay is a little over $4,500 per month. So while I’m not completely screwed, I only end up with like $100 or maybe $200 going into my savings every month which seems ridiculous.\n\nMy gut instinct is to sell the car (privately?) and buy something way cheaper. I love my car to death but this does not seem sustainable.\n\nI never really learned how to budget anything so I’m totally winging this. I don’t have anyone to ask for help and I have no clue what a reasonable budget looks like.\n\nI’ve written out my budget in extreme detail and  really the rest of it is just groceries, gas, utilities, pet insurance, and like a couple small subscription services like Spotify and Amazon. I don’t understand why I’m drowning.\n\nWould welcome any resources that could help me figure out how to reasonably budget, and any advice on how others would handle this.\n\nEdit: Really really appreciate all the perspective here. You are all totally right, I was dishonest about the roommate bit of the story. Roommate is actually my abusive boyfriend who I am kicking out. I pay 2/3 of the rent, he pays the remainder ($500). With him gone, I pay it all. I think that was probably my fatal mistake, not the car.\n\nWe do live in a pretty HCOL area. I spend about $75 per week on groceries but sometimes go over. It’s not really enough lol. I eat out maybe 2-3 times per week, probably spend about $15-20 each time. I really don’t go out beyond that.\n\nHere’s my actual budget. Mayo refers to Mayo Clinic, not mayonnaise. I have tons of medical issues so I have a monthly required payment for all the appointments there.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/lJDkDGW\n\nEdit #2: Thank you so much for all the help. A few clarifications:\n\nSomeone pointed out that my eating out budget as laid out in my budget spreadsheet is inaccurate. I totally missed that and it should read closer to ~200 per month at max. Thanks for catching that! I will be aiming to cut down on eating out now.\n\nI know this probably doesn’t instill much faith in the rest of the budget but I double checked everything and I do believe the rest is accurate.\n\nIn terms of CC, I have about $800 on the Apple Card which I just try to meet the monthly on. Some people have indicated that I should pay this off more aggressively so I will try that from now on.\n\nFor the Amex, I am on my mom’s card and having a tough time getting her to remove me. I don’t spend on it really ever, but I put a few bucks on it every month to help her out. This probably sounds insane given the state of my budget. I will try to have a conversation about stopping those payments.\n\nAnd lastly, I live in basically a 1 bedroom, 2 bathroom. We also have a room that is referred to on the floor plan as a den. I’m not sure if my landlord would allow me to add a roommate to live in the den? Or if anyone would even want to pay $1000 to live in a den. It’s decently small, but could probably fit a small bed and desk if you really tried. Really just not sure on the legality of that I guess since it isn’t referred to as a bedroom.\n\nI will present the situation to my landlord and ask about moving to a different unit as a solution.\n\nEdit #3: I did the IRS tax withholding estimator and I actually don’t withhold enough apparently. For federal, I have $349.69 coming out per paycheck, and state is $60.32 per paycheck. It says I should withhold an additional $35 per pay period.\n\n$199.97 per paycheck goes into Social Security, and I put $159.61 per paycheck into my HSA. The HSA amount is pretty non negotiable unfortunately, I have a lot of medical bills.\n\nThank you so much for all the help!! I’m sorry for leaving out some details initially, this is all new to me. Please feel free to ask any other clarifying questions!\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "I recently received 130,000 of apple stock from an investment that was made for me when I was a child. I took out a margin loan against the stock of 56k (number not included in the previous 130k value. So technically I have 186k of stock) to pay for a masters degree and living expenses in London. I understand that having all eggs in one basket is dumb, but to diversify I’ll be charged capital gains tax on whatever I sell per year that’s over 50k.  \n  \nSo I guess the questions are.. When should I pay off the rest of the margin loan? (if I pay any more this year, I will trigger capital gains since I already have 50k of earnings this year), when should I sell more Apple to diversify my portfolio, and where should I diversify into? I live in the US and all my family and friends are telling me that the US dollar is facing an inevitable crash and that the best thing to do would be to invest in other currencies like crypto.   \n  \nThoughts? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Also, should I just hire a financial advisor? Or is that stupid this day and age? I'm the furthest thing from a finances/economics person myself.",

My wife and I did stop at two out of area stores yesterday, so I wasn't entirely surprised, because I did not see the charges from one of them clear my account yet. Figured maybe that's what triggered everything, or where they got the info from. \nThey asked if I did tap to pay or inserted my card, and I informed them I used apple pay.\nThe guy made me feel comfortable, so when he asked for my bank login username to help track it down the IP, I absent mindedly answered. 30 seconds later I realized \"wait a minute, they never ask that....shit\"\n30 seconds or so of conversation and brief holds while the system catches up, he asks me to verify the first 5 of my SSN. \"No\" was my response.\n\"No problem sir, I'll see if I can bypass that so we can continue getting this multi factor authentication enabled for you. One moment\" and the red flags were waving like crazy.\nI ask the guy for his name, and he gives me a name and a banking ID number, and I ask \"And I'll get an email with full documentation on this?\" \n\"Yes sir, we'll send it to the e-mail on file\"\n\"And can you verify what e-mail you'll be sending this to?\" and they hung up on me. \n\nI tried calling the bank immediately afterwards, and their phones are down. They are still down. I even tried from a neighbors phone incase mine was acting up. Their phones are still down 5 hours after they called me. \n\nWhat they got from me: Full billing address, bank username (not password), last 4 of social, and verification of my wife's maiden name is on the account. I immediately transferred everything I could to a friend since I cannot get a hold of anyone at my bank likely until Monday (unless they can get their phones back on and will open up a line). \n\nI feel so damn stupid.

        "selftext": "This post arises out of some thoughts I had after my friend got robbed recently. We don’t talk much on this sub about the risks that having your finances electronically integrated into your smartphone poses, but my friends situation demonstrates what can go wrong.\n\nAfter a late night at the bars, my friend was jumped and the attackers took his wallet and made him give them the passcode to his phone, draining his checking account and gaining access to all his cards on applepay. He was effectively helpless for 3-4 days. The robbers took all of his credit cards (both the ones in his wallet and applepay) and so he needed to cancel all of them immediately. He had no access to a payment method  for food, a new phone, or anything else. His dad had to ship him a new phone (they took his id so he couldn’t even pick one up that had been pre paid) and DoorDash him food for a few days until he got everything together.\n\nThis got me thinking that I’m (and probably a lot of people) are in a very similar situation. All my cards are on applepay with the exception of one. I also carry them in my wallet just in case. However, if either my wallet or phone gets stolen, I have to cancel them all anyway. I leave one card at home just in case, but I fear if I report a theft on the other card on the account that they will close both cards. My bank account can also be accessed using my phones password. \n\nWhat does Plan B look like from a personal finance perspective? Here are a few things that come to mind: \n\n1. Should I have a store of emergency cash? How much would you store? I don’t want too much money out of my savings accounts or investments not accruing interest. \n\n2.How can I theft proof my bank accounts and credit cards? If they have access to my phone password it’s all over. Conversely, if I carry my cards in my wallet and they steal it then it’s also over. I have four cards that I potentially need to use on a daily basis and can leave only one card at home and off Apple Pay.\n\nI don’t want to ever end up as helpless and vulnerable as my friend, what is your solution?

The most helpful person was a local Chase bank guy who is going to call his back line support desk with the account number.

        "selftext": "I was injured in a car crash last year and I'm finally receiving the settlement money, after all the bills it comes down to around $17k.  \n  \nI'm only 19, I haven't had my first job yet (although im trying to find one) and I really want to be financially responsible with the money since I understand most people my age don't usually come into this amount of money. I was considering using 1.5k of it to buy a used car from my boyfriend's sister which she's been trying to sell because I don't have a car yet and I think having reliable transportation would open a lot of doors for me, help me to more independent, and help with getting a job among other things. Although, I understand that buying a car would mean paying for gas, insurance, registration, and repairs if necessary which I will probably be forced to use the settlement money on unless I can quickly find a job.  \n  \nMy dad is really against the idea, he keeps opting that I just borrow his car when I need it so all I need to pay is insurance, but I know if I do that then I won't have the autonomy I really want with a car. I'm very tired of being dependent on my boyfriend for rides, or anybody really. I feel bad inconveniencing people with it. My boyfriend doesn't seem to mind too much, but it just bothers me. There are things I want to do by myself that I can't do by myself because I don't have a car, and I don't think my dad would be for me using his car for those activities either because of gas. He wants me to use the car for needs, not wants. I suppose the fix here is offering to pay for gas myself. I'm just stuck though, could this be a good opportunity for me to gain some independence by buying my first car or should I continue to rely on my dad's until I at least have a job?\n\nAside from this, I really *want* to use the money for other things too: a good gaming pc and maybe an iphone, just upgrades I've been wanting for years. I've been an android user forever because that's what my dad put me on. It's fine, but I honestly wish I could get the exclusive features apple users get. I'm a sucker for customizability, I want facetime, and there are so many things that just operate better on ios compared to android because that's what most apps cater to. The main selling point for me though is the good camera. I really hate my samsung camera. I've been stuck with it for YEARS, the lighting in every picture is always terrible, and almost every time I take a selfie it slaps a filter on top that I can't remove which makes the photo look awful. I am so discouraged from taking photos because of how bad that camera is, and it upsets me because I feel like I miss out on documenting my experiences. I rely almost completely on my boyfriend for photo-taking now, and they always look so good on his iphone 11. I've asked for an iphone as a birthday gift for multiple years, but my dad has always refused. Now I finally have the money to buy one, but don't know if I should. \n\nOn the other hand, I know digital cameras produce absoloutely BREATH-TAKING pictures, better than iphone imo. I'm wondering if buying a good digital camera and sticking to my samsung would be a better investment if I were to buy something to upgrade my photos.\n\nI've also never had my own laptop or computer, everything I've ever used in that category has belonged to my dad and while they've always gotten the job done, they're of course not designed with gaming in mind. I love playing games, but have been stuck solely to nintendo products because those were the consoles my dad bought when I was younger (Wii, Wii U, Nintendo Switch). I like my switch, but being stuck to this one company limits me a lot and I really want to upgrade to my own pc so I can explore more titles. I understand that a solid top-notch pc costs around 2k though, and getting into pc-building is a whole other can of worms. It honestly would be a dream come true to make this upgrade, I've wanted my own desktop since I was in 5th grade, but don't think it's the most responsible decision.\n\nOverall, I'm just not sure how much I should allow myself to spend, what to spend on, and how much I should save, I know high-yield saving accounts exist too but since I only just opened my bank account to hold the settlement money, I don't yet completely understand how to do that. I've know investing could be a good decision as well but I know that carries some risk, so i'm not sure how worth-it that route is.  \n  \nSorry for the wall of text, guidance would just be greatly appreciated from those more experienced than me!",

        "selftext": "Hello, I'm currently 18 and am saving up to get my first car. I work part time and save $1200 a month to my savings for my car. At the moment i've narrowed it down to me wanting a white honda accord or civic (very specific i know lol). But anyways, i'm currently living at home and don't have to pay rent. I'm kind of thinking to get a newer model only because I want apple carplay which i know is very unnecessary extra $5000 or so Lol. So the price for a car would be about $24,000. I don't plan on getting one until jan 2026 most likely as I am trying to save up about 80% the amount of the car so im comfortably able to pay it off. If it matters at all, im also in college as a pre nursing student. I've thought about getting a beater car but don't really see the point because i'd rather just share with my mom or brother at that point which i currently am doing. So for the first couple of years of paying off the loan it should be a breeze and i'll continue putting money away for the remaining amount. By january i should have about $18,000 saved so yes yes. It's like, i just want to have fun to go out with friends and decorate my car all cute you know. I have enough of a down payment to go car shopping now but I would rather just save up about 80% of the cost because it makes me feel safer if anything were to happen. I definitely don't plan on getting another car until this one would break down on me lol. Also to add on I just got my first credit card this past november, i also opened a 2nd one in december and it's been going well. I don't have a fico score yet but my vantage score is around 710 woo. Also please no criticism on how i should invest my money, I just see no point in saving a ridiculous amount of money when I haven't even started my career yet. I mean obviously I will rebuild my savings overtime but keep in mind i am not a 57 year old man so i feel like i dont need to invest all my money, Lol. Maybe once i turn 20 ill put away a hundred bucks a month or so, but i think i would love to get a car payment out of my way first, thank you!",

        "title": "I have no idea how I could save for retirement outside of 401k (which isn’t enough) due to household income. ",
        "selftext": "I want to express that my husband and I recognize our good fortune with a household income of $300k, but I regret some financial decisions we've made.\n\nBackground: \n\nI'm 31 and my husband is 34. Although our income seems high, our savings and retirement plans are concerning, especially with a baby on the way. Earlier this year, we depleted our savings to pay off debts like student loans and car payments, leaving us with only our mortgage (still owe $100k). \n\nMy husband graduated at 23 and reached a salary of over $80k, but he had $40k in student debt and didn’t start saving until about 4-5 years ago due to limited financial literacy. I graduated at 25, only earning a salary (60k) after covering school expenses. As a result, both of us began contributing to retirement and savings later in life, starting slowly as we built an emergency fund and because we bought a house.\n\nFinances:\n\nNow I make around $126k & husband makes $175k. Bring total household income before tax at = $301k\n\nDebt: We emptied most of our savings at the beginning of this year because we both had large jumps in salary and something got messed up on our w4’s (we work at the same company) and owed 10k in taxes, we paid off our student loans, the siding of our house, our car note (we have 1 car for now until baby comes), etc. \n\nSavings: We penny pinched and now we are at 30k for savings and 10k for upcoming baby expenses for the next year. We both work in Tech and with layoffs constantly happening we’ve been advised to save as if one of us could not find a job for a year. \n\nRetirement: I only have $74k in 401k, and was only able to save 10k in Roth/traditional IRA. My husband has 100k in 401k (nothing else). I keep seeing you need 1x your salary in retirement before 30 to stay on track IF we still have social security (which I can’t count on). \n\nHousehold expenses: We’re remote employees so moved to a new state and got a 2 year lease to see if we wanted to permanently move (but we’ve decided to move back to our home to save money). We’re required to have our own offices with a lock so we’re trying to buy a new home with baby coming (current home is a 2 bedroom turned 3 (dinning room was turned into a bedroom). \n\nMortgage: $1000\n\nRent (until March 2025): $ 3000\n\nTotal Utilities: $ 350\n\nCar/house/renters insurance: $ 337\nInternet: $ 100\n\nSubscriptions (includes pet insurance, gym, Costco, apple care, cancer insurance, and streaming): $ 283\n\nMisc bills: $1900\n\nTotal expenses for now= $6970\n\nTotal expenses once we move back to our house in March = $ 3970 (not included extra baby stuff and new car note).\n\nConcern: I feel like there are no additional options for savings outside of our 401k and just a HYS account. We jumped salaries kinda quickly (before we even knew anything about financial literacy) so we never took advantage of IRAs before we legally  no longer could contribute to them without being double taxed. High yield savings accounts don’t build wealth, and I don’t see us ever being able to retire. Especially because we plan to pay for our child’s college so they can have a better start at life than we did (especially a better life than me because I grew up dirt poor, like my family wouldn’t be able to eat or go to the doctor without us having lived in a super awesome state that had generous social services). \n\nWe have a good savings potential but realistically it’s not enough to grow the way a retirement account would. We’re learning about finances as we go along and had no guidance but the internet. What are our options? \n\nEdit (1): Forgot to mention we both have medical issues that will not make retirement age less costly even if a home is paid off. They will get worse with age and husband will most certainly need a heart transplant later in life. Luckily nothing we’d pass on to baby but still stinks!",

Or should I stay invested?\nIf I hold, how long should I realistically expect to wait just to get back to my original value?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts from those with more experience!",

        "selftext": "I’m a college student in my 4th of 5 years in college. I’m also in a long distance relationship, and fly there a few times a year to see him. I’m planning out flights so I can book before they get rid of the checked bag policy and contemplating getting a Rapid Rewards card as I have thought about a good bit in the past.  Usually, I pay with an Apple Credit Card. I’m not very financially versed so please bear with me.\n\nIn 2023, I flew them twice and spent $928.11. We started dating in July, so that’s twice in 6 months.\n\nIn 2024, I flew with them twice again, including a one way for my boyfriend and total spent was   $1017.97. We also had a Delta one way flight for both of us that could have been southwest but my boyfriend chose that one. \n\nSo far in 2025, we used my account to fly him here and I’ve booked my visit for June-August, so total spent has been $905.52. We plan on flying to New York for a week in the summer, which is looking like it will cost $772.74 including all fees. I will also be going there for winter break one way which will cost $213.18. After that, we go to my and his family for the holidays, which will total minimum $925.12. Then, he flies back in very early January for $233.18. Minimum total for 2025 is $3049.74. I always get the cheapest flight at the lowest tier that works for the trip and our schedule. \n\nI graduate next year, so there will most likely be only one more visit before then, as well as plane tickets for him to come to my graduation and for us to move wherever we move (although we will probably end up driving) After that, outside of maybe holidays I don’t see myself flying too often. I sometimes wish I had gotten it sooner but I can’t change the past, and I can’t even really tell if it would have been worth it.\n\nRight now, Southwest is having a promotion where if you apply today you can get a companion pass through 2/28/26 plus 30k bonus points after spending $4k in the first 3 months. It ends after today, so should I apply? $69 annually, and I would pay off anything I use it for immediately.\n\nThis is all really confusing stuff to me and I’m trying to learn and figure it out but I’m really struggling. \n\nTLDR; Long distance relationship makes me fly more than I usually would but that will end in less than 2 years, should I get the RR card?\n\nETA: Thank you to all who have given me advice, and confirmed that my hesitation was valid. I’m gonna be looking into other choices of cards.",

        "selftext": "Hi all! Like the title says, I have some questions about age of credit and how best to deal with that.\n\nI am 24f and my partner is 26m. Both of us opened up Discover credit cards when we were in college (somewhere in the 2018-2020 range for both of us). I opened up another two credit cards eventually, one two years ago through Apple, and then another one last year that is a travel card. My partner has not opened any yet. He has a car loan and a bike loan, whereas I have none. We plan to have a mortgage next year. \n\nThe Discover card is nice, but I do feel as though it isn't working for us in a few different ways. My partner wants to go ahead and open up another card, but we are just feeling like idiots when it comes to our credit score. So here are a few questions we had:\n\n1. Should we just leave our Discover cards open and not use them? Or should we try and put something small on them each month?\n2. What would closing our Discover cards do to our credit score? Is that a really dumb choice to make?\n3. Does adding him as an authorized user to my account help his score in any way?\n4. Does his opening another credit card look good or bad for future lenders? We may have to look into getting the mortgage as soon as February of next year, so I don't want to do anything rash.\n5. What is a good age for credit? Is there even any point to closing the Discover ever? \n\nThank you all for any help! Sorry if these are dumb questions, I just feel out of my element a bit, and we are trying to set ourselves up for success. When I opened the Discover, I did no research into what kind of card would work for me. We would like to really give it some thought, look at pros and cons, and the benefits to our life, and then open cards that support that, but only if it makes sense. It feels like we should be \"using\" the system more since we both are good about paying it off, but I just don't know how or if that even makes sense. Thank you!!!!!",

        "selftext": "**TLDR**: I'm unsure whether I should calculate Operating Cash Flow manually or not when a company co-mingles current and non-current assets and liabilities on their cash flow statement.\n\n\n\nFor Operating Cash Flow, the formula is:\n\n    Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation + Amortization + Other Non-cash Expenses - Non-cash Income - Change in Working Capital\n\nwhere the Working Capital part of Change in Working Capital is defined as:\n\n    Working Capital = Current Operational Assets - Current Operational Liabilities\n\nI've read numerous times that it's important to exclude non-current assets and liabilities from working capital.\n\nI've also found it frequently recommended to use the \"*Cash generated by operating activities*\" line from the cash flow Statement as the value for operating cash flow.\n\nSome companies co-mingle non-current assets and liabilities in \"*Changes in operating assets and liabilities*\" on the cash flow statement. For example, in Apple's Q3 2024 10-Q:  [https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc\\_earnings/2024/q3/filing/\\_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2024/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf)\n\nIt seems reasonable to me to use the numbers of the Cash Flow Statement since it's basically a statement by the company on how they think of their cash flow.\n\nBut, I'm also not sure if there's a reason to be strict about the exclusion of non-current assets and liabilities, even if they're included in \"*Changes in operating assets and liabilities*\".\n\nI've looked all over the web, asked ChatpGPT, and searched past posts in this and other subs. Unfortunately, I haven't found a clear, reasoned answer for this particular situation.\n\nIf someone could help with an explanation on how to think about this particular issue and the fundamental reasoning and/or historical context, I'd be very grateful!",

Apple just launched an update (only for developers tho) and soon we´ll see a new “Apple Intelligence” in all our devices. If everything goes well, this will be available this fall.\n\n\n\nIn other Apple news, if you were paying attention back in 2018, Tim Cook, our famous CEO said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rate (like Brazil and Russia), there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple decided to cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.\n\n\n\nAnd just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.\n\n\n\nThis led to several big scandals and lawsuits based on Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).\n\n\n\nSo, at this point, this whole story is going to an end because recently, Apple decided to pay $490M to investors due to the situation (even before the court hearing), so if you were one of those damaged investors, you can[ check it out](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).\n\n\n\nHowever, does that half a billion even come close to covering the $70 billion loss? Especially with all the drama Apple's dealing with in China?\n\n",

I wanted to share my strategy, what I’ve accomplished so far, and hopefully hear about your approaches too!\n\nHere’s how I’m building my portfolio:\n\nReinvesting all dividends\nEvery dollar I earn in dividends goes straight back into buying more shares. Compounding is a powerful force, and this strategy helps my income grow faster.\n\nFocusing on companies with stable dividends\nI prioritize companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Coca-Cola (KO), and McDonald’s (MCD) for their decades-long track record of steady payouts. They’re the foundation of my passive income.\n\nDiversifying with ETFs\nFunds like SCHD and JEPI give me exposure to a broad range of companies, balancing growth and income potential.\n\nAdding REITs for monthly income\nRealty Income (O) and STAG Industrial (STAG) pay monthly dividends, which feel like small wins every month and could cover expenses as my portfolio grows.\n\nIncluding growth companies with dividends\nI also hold Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). While their dividends aren’t as high as some others, I see long-term capital appreciation with a dividend bonus.\n\nRight now, I need around $30,000 annually to cover basic expenses, and my portfolio has reached about 10% of that target. It feels great to see progress, even if it’s slow and steady!\n\nI’d love to hear from you, what’s working well for you on your dividend journey? Which sectors or strategies do you think are best for long-term sustainability?",

I feel like Apple falls into this category, so I'm just curious why they dividend is only 0.53% as it looks like the've stopped innovating their products and they sell the products year by year.\n\nIn addition, pharmaceutical companies with high dividends spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new drugs, so would've their dividend be low as the need their money to reinvest in new drugs?\n\nThe answer may be obvious but I'm just curious.",

Even the meme TSLA outperforms rotten AAPL. AMZN is doing better job than AAPL on the market.\n\n**AI**\n\nIn my opinion, AI is overrated. The market wants to see more AI-related news from AAPL. However, AAPL has no in-house LLMs.\n\nLLMs are cloud-based commodities, which will be run at marginal cost. Since Deepseek, we know that open source-based LLMs are just commodities and have no MOAT.\n\nThere has been a rumor that AAPL might buy Perplexity. But Perplexity relies on GUI system and no in-house LLMs. Perplexity as a GUI system based company orchestrates ChatGPT, Claude, Antrophic, and Gemini to provide results out of that.\n\nThere is no MOAT. It would be a failed M&A for AAPL if AAPL acquires Perplexity.\n\nPerplexity has no traction, because this company is not even in TOP 100 at App Store.\n\nWhen we get the news that even META tried to talk to Perplexity for a possible M&A, I highly assumes that Perplexity offers themselves, because:\n\n1. Perplexity knows that they can´t survive as a stand alone company sooner or later.\n2. the bankers want to drive the market value of Perplexity up.\n\nAAPL is lagging behind in AI, but AAPL can power their competitive advantages with their powerful eco-system (iOS). AAPL needs to figure out how to provide a solid feature to users.\n\nSiri must be more intelligent. As AAPL has doomed Siri for over 10 years and has presented their future direction with Siri already at WWDC 2024, the time is ticking that AAPL needs to deliver their promise.\n\n**Tariffs**\n\nIt is not AAPL´s fault, but AAPL has been very timid. AAPL has moved their production for the US market from China to India. However, Trump dissed Tim Cook that he does not like their re-location from China to India. Instead of that, Trump would like to see AAPL move from China to the US.\n\nSince then, Tim Cook has been silent. It gives a clear contradiction from Jensen Huang from Nvidia reacted when his super computer H-20 is banned for China.\n\nJensen Huang immediately responded to this action and has been on trips world wide to cover the potential loss from China. He was very pro-active to Trump to keep Nvdia´s stock performance. But Tim Cook has been very timid so far and does not really show his pro-active move to negotiate with Trump.\n\nWhile other CEOs are chasing AI-startups and talents, Tim Cook rather hangs out with Hollywood stars for premier F1.\n\nTariffs will affect AAPL negatively. If Tariffs will drive their sales down, we will see in the upcoming Q2, Q3 and Q4.\n\n**Slow innovation**\n\nPeople claim that AAPL has lost their innovative mindset. However, the innovation has never been the reason for their success. iPhone was not the first smartphone.\n\nThe reason for their success is that AAPL has provided the most optimized solution for user-friendly device. I can´t imagine to type blackberry or Nokia things. Additionally, Sony, which introduced the first concept of a smartphone, could not provide a seamless solution for their concept, because Sony was so behind in Software and eco-system based infrastructure.\n\nAAPL could master a seamless and user-friendly device with their own iOS eco-system, which just works.\n\n\"It works\" principle has been the reason for their success.\n\nHowever, AAPL is very slow to bring out some HW-related features. Their foldable phone will be launched next year although Samsung has been on the foldable market for 7 years already.\n\nThere is also a rumor that AAPL can´t achieve their original design (All Glass) for 20th anniversary.\n\nAAPL needs to justify why people should upgrade their phones. But until now, AAPL has failed to provide a proper solution for that. People still buy iPhones, but their growth rate is just under 5% at PE (FWD) 26x.\n\n**What can drive AAPL up?**\n\nSimple. Tim Cook needs to deliver \"way better than expected\" Q2 to get back to where AAPL was at the end of last year. Additionally, Tim Cook needs to deliver a promising forecast even if AAPL does not give any forecasts, but Tim Cook needs to let Wall Street know that AAPL is quite confident to beat the market.\n\nAAPL needs to promote more about their healthcare-driven strategy. I strongly believe that AAPL is heavily and serioulsy interested in healthcare sector. But AAPL has been very timid and had some lawsuits with other companies for patents at Apple Watch.\n\n",

Many market commentators proclaimed that Apple “lost its edge” and was well passed their prime. This was basically consensus opinion at the time, every analyst and news article was playing the same song. Here are a few headlines:During Berkshire’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett attributed much of Berkshire’s performance to the compounding ability of Apple ($AAPL). He went as far as thanking the CEO personally.\n\nThe Apple bet is notable not only for it’s fantastic returns, but by the shear scale of the capital deployed ($35 billion over the years). Berkshire’s investable universe is severely limited to large cap companies that can really “move the needle.” It is rare for large cap giants, covered by armies of analysts, to be severely mispriced. Seizing a large position in Apple during a period of temporary turbulence was a masterstroke. It is instructive to understand Berkshire’s reasoning at the time and what the situation looked like to most investors.\n\nThere were plenty of good reasons for Apple’s stock to fall at the time. Overall, they appeared to become a lethargic and oversized stalwart, likened to IBM. They lost their image as a fast growing innovator that had found its second wind in consumer electronics (it is easy to forget that Apple was founded back in 1976).\n\nThis was not a founder-led business anymore. During the Steve Jobs period, they had come up with sleek minimalist designs and a series of products that delighted consumers (iPod, iTouch and iPhone). By 2016 this momentum had stagnated, reflected in somewhat repetitive iterations of their products. Apple began to branch off into the car industry with *Project Titan,* which ran unsuccessfully from 2014-2024. This would be an example of Peter Lynch’s term “diworsification.” There were also a few short-term causes for concern:\n\n1. Apple reported its first year-over-year sales decline since 2003.\n2. First-ever drop in iPhone unit sales. Deemed to be over-reliant on the iPhone.\n3. Spent more money on its new campus than on research and development.\n4. Chinese regulators shut down Apple’s online book/video services.\n\n**In 2016, the company’s PE ratio dropped under 13** to complete the set-up. The **earnings yield was 8-9%** throughout the year.\n\n**Taking out the big guns:**\n\nBerkshire began with a $1 billion investment in Apple in the first quarter of 2016, increasing their position continuously over the course of the year. While market commentators were focused on short-term headwinds, Berkshire was focused on the underlying quality of Apple’s business. They saw through the noise and perceived the true *essence* of the business. The secret sauce.\n\nIn a press release from October 2016 by *Manager Magazin* (a German business magazine), Ted Weschler explained the rationale behind Berkshire Hathaway’s Apple investment:\n\n>*Apple has elements of a subscription model that protects it from competition and could keep margins elevated for the long term, according to major investor Berkshire Hathaway. That is a large difference to former smartphone competitors Nokia, Blackberry and Motorola…*\n\n>*Weschler says that the smartphone business had been transformed by the app economy and cloud computing. “As network speed has gotten faster and faster, and with it the information that people can absorb on the network, things like photo applications, and apps, they create a stickier ecosystem”. “Once you are fully invested in the App ecosystem and you have got your thousands of photographs up in the cloud and you are used to the keystrokes and functionality and where everything is, you become a sticky consumer.”*\n\nThey recognized the importance of a sticky ecosystem in retaining consumers over time. There was a powerful interplay between the Mac operating system, downloading from the iStore, listening to iTunes, storage on iCloud, communication on iMessenger/FaceTime and all the other products starting with “i”. Even their chargers were only compatible with Apple devices at the time. This ecosystem offered convenience for its users while secretly increasing switching costs. Consumers would have to expend mental effort in order to learn a new system that was less integrated.\n\nBerkshire was not a group of technology experts, but they were experts on consumer behavior. While innovation was important, Apple did not need to produce the most advanced technology to be successful. Their higher profit margins were due to their brand image and the stickiness of their ecosystem. Buffett recognized that Apple users would rather “[give up a second car](https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/06/buffett-says-apple-best-business-of-any-he-owns/)” than give up their iPhone. Delighted customers translated into incredible brand loyalty and massive returns on capital. Even during the 2016-2017 trough, their ROIC hardly ever went below 20% before re-accelerating back into the 40% range. Maintaining a high ROIC over long periods of time is an indicator of a true competitive advantage.\n\n**The Results:**\n\nThey added to their position continuously over the years and their total $35 billion investment was worth $173 billion in 2023. \n\n\\- Stock Doctor\n\n[Find the full article and charts here.](https://stockdoctor.substack.com/p/case-study-berkshires-big-bet-on?r=2c93i1)",

        "selftext": "So BRK sold half of it’s 5.6% ownership of APPL and there has been a lot of speculation as to why.  I base my analysis on the idea of discounting cash, in particular, the retained earnings of APPL attributable to the ownership of BRK. The 5.6% ownership generates 5.6 billion of retained earnings yearly (Warren even mentions it in an annual shareholder letter, but the calculation is trivial). Now, *given current interest* rates one can earn 5.5 billion just by having 100 billion invested in US T-bills.\n\nConsidering that the market cap for APPL in this period was 3300 billion, then 5.6% gives us 184 billion of market value. In other words, BRK could sell a little over half of its holdings and have 84 billion invested at AAPL and 100 billion in cash. Thus, it will have 2 billion in retained earnings, *plus* 5.5 billion of the 100 billion *in cash* it would get from the transaction.\n\nIt might be argued that interest rates could drop substantially, but again at current market levels this would not be the case unless the market went down considerably. In which case the yearly interest does go down, but then the usefulness of the 100 billion in cash does skyrocket. Finally, corporate taxes at 21% did made Warren justify a bit that it’s not necessarily a bad rate compared to what it can be (52% in the past).",

They also have the fattest pocketbook in the world and can enter what business they damn please---for example like they did with apple a few years ago. Built to endure.\n2. **Amazon (AMZN):** Unrivalled logistics and cloud infrastructure (AWS) create a nearly insurmountable moat; their scale and efficiency in delivering both physical goods and digital services are unmatched. They are sort of the digital backbone of America, for both retail and essential cloud infrastructure. Competitors can't replicate this position overnight, if ever.

Financial system backbone, hard to see it go away. The largest banks have changed over time though. There are temptations to be stupid in banking and that can have big consequences. Citi used to be king; Lehman actually went bust. Still i think JPM is for ever. \n   * **Moody's (MCO):** Ratings agencies = near-monopoly in a for ever necessary service.

        "selftext": "Today, I'm diving into the lessons from the 2022 stock market crash and how they apply to the current market downturn. Are we seeing history repeat itself with new opportunities emerging?\n\nMy original post: [https://deepvalueanalysis.substack.com/p/2022-crash-vs-today-lessons-learned](https://deepvalueanalysis.substack.com/p/2022-crash-vs-today-lessons-learned)\n\n# A. Lessons from the 2022 Crash\n\n# A.1. Lessons about Financials and Valuations\n\n**a. OCF and FCF are #2, and #1 respectively**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nNet income has been debunked time and time as a good measure of value in investments, but it is still being taken at face value by many investors and I believe that all value investors, including myself, ought to explain why it is not a good measurement.\n\nFirst of all, the reason OCF is much better is that you are actually measuring the real cash flow of your business. You don’t pay dividends or do stock buybacks from amortization or depreciation. You can’t change OCF whenever you want through complicated accounting methods. (Check [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal)) - Enron is a classic case study of why you never look at NI without first checking OCF and FCF.\n\nSecond of all, OCF has an even better alternative, and that is FCF. FCF is the big test of whether OCF is “Bullsh\\*t” or “Real”. Now, you may be asking yourself what do I mean by this. What I am referring to is the classic case of heavy CapEx companies that have high OCF and low FCF. After all, OCF is only useful if you can spend it, but if a company constantly requires high CapEx, then the real measure of value is FCF. (Check Auto, Steel and Industrial).\n\nPractical Example:  \nTech which has both high OCF and high FCF recovered extremely well from the 2022 drop, whilst Auto, Steel and Industrials are lacking. Intel is a tech business that is the epitome of “Spend until you drop”\n\n**b. Valuations don’t last forever**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nAll bubbles pop, I don’t think that it is necessary to explain the concept too much, because everyone knows that nothing lasts forever, in particular stock market bubbles.\n\nPractical Example:  \n1907, 1929, 1937, 1962, 1987, 1990, 2000, 2008, 2020, 2022, 2025 (Now).\n\n**c. FFO, AFFO for REITs**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nWhen you’re dealing with REITs, traditional metrics like Net Income or even Free Cash Flow can lead you seriously astray. Why? Because of the unique accounting treatment of real estate—specifically depreciation. Imagine owning a building that gains value every year, but accounting tells you it’s losing value because of depreciation. That’s exactly what happens with REITs.\n\nThat’s where Funds From Operations (FFO) comes in. FFO adds back depreciation and amortization to net income, and removes gains on sales of property, giving a clearer picture of how much cash the REIT is actually generating from its operations. It’s like OCF, but real estate flavored.\n\nBut even FFO isn’t the full picture. Enter Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)—this metric goes one step further by subtracting recurring CapEx (maintenance costs, tenant improvements, etc.). AFFO is essentially the REIT version of Free Cash Flow, showing what the REIT can actually return to shareholders after keeping the lights on.\n\nIf FFO is “cash coming in,” then AFFO is “cash you can actually use.” That’s why savvy REIT investors focus heavily on AFFO per share growth.\n\nPractical Example:\n\nTake Realty Income (O), the so-called “Monthly Dividend Company.” On a net income basis, it can look underwhelming. But when you look at its FFO and AFFO, it becomes obvious why investors prize its dividend reliability. On the other hand, watch out for REITs that trumpet high FFO but constantly issue shares or take on debt just to cover CapEx—they might look like cash cows but are actually cash traps.\n\n**d. Normalized FCF during Bubbles - A great tool**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nUsing normalized FCF during Bubbles is very helpful because you know exactly how to value the company in a situation where the bubble pops and CapEx drops significantly (because that shiny new tech/trend no longer matters to investors). A company may have almost identical FCF during and after a bubble and during the popping of a bubble, multiples contract considerably, and so this type of company will be left out to rot in the stock market. But, on the other hand, companies like GOOG that have very high temporary AI CapEx could easily cut back on this spending and have a much higher FCF in a short time, therefore counteracting the multiples contraction.\n\nPractical Example:\n\nI posted a recent article on the 2025 AI bubble where I gave a few examples of what valuations companies would deserve in a no-bubble scenario. Check it out [here](https://deepvalueanalysis.substack.com/p/beyond-the-ai-hype-analysing-market).\n\n# A.2. Lessons about the Value Investor Mindset\n\n**a. Roughly Two main types of Investments**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:\n\nThere are two main types of investments based on sound analysis and that meet the Benjamin Graham definition of an investment and not speculation:  \n1. ***Cigar Butt/Deep Value Play***\n\n2. ***Buffett Play***\n\n**The Cigar Butt/Deep Value Play** is mostly when you find an extremely undervalued company at a good MOS (>30%) and that has little to no future growth prospects. These are meant to be sold at fair value, or slightly above, usually giving a quick 50-70% profit. (In most cases they also give a big dividend so the total return is closer to 75%).\n\n**The Buffett Play** can be done at or below fair value, but it has to be a very high quality company with an impenetrable moat and good future growth prospects. These can be held “**forever**”. They are to be sold only when there is an extreme bubble (trading >2.5 times fair value), when the moat is in danger, or when there is a serious personal need for money.\n\nPractical Example:  \nCigar Butt - BTI (bought in at 29.3$ in May last year, and made +35% incl. Dividends, during the same time the S&P grew 3% incl. Dividends) - numbers given to exemplify a normal return for a cigar butt play.  \nA lot of REITS fall under Cigar Butt. My most recent REIT play was HIW (+80% in 1 year - basically the maximum realistic gain on a Cigar Butt in the current market)\n\nBuffett Play - AAPL, NFLX (2022-2025), MSFT (Post-2000 - Now), AMZN (Post-2000 - Now), AXP (1991-Now), etc.\n\n**b. Handling a >-30% drop**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nYou shouldn’t let emotions control your investments, after all, it’s just numbers. Almost **ALL** of my investments have gone in the red before becoming profitable. I could start talking for hours about how to control yourself, but the truth is that some people are just not ready to stomach a >30% loss. I’ve been there, and it’s very hard. Some like me learn from mistakes and can be transformed into someone who can stand these losses, there are also some who naturally tolerate them, but there is also a subset of investors who can’t handle them. To those investors I recommend automatic debit to an index fund account and to never look at it.\n\nPractical example:\n\nBeing -50% on a stock that you did a whole investment thesis on and wanting to pull your hairs out, but you resist selling, and after some time you start gaining: -30%, -20%, -5%, +5%, +30%. It’s a slow process but it happens, and at the end you’ve come out on top as a better investor who has just managed to control his emotions. Great Job!\n\n**c. Misinterpreting drops in price**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nPeople act on emotions and when they see a 20% drop in a week and a negative article on seeking alpha they believe that they made a bad investment. Trust me, if you do your DD and you understand the company, some random SA article or random drop shouldn’t scare you. I have learnt this from personal experience and the only way to pass this is to feel it for yourself several times to skip over the bullsh\\*t of Mr. Market.\n\nPractical Example:  \nNVDA end of 2022 - Great fundamentals but it was being battered by both Mr. Market and “Analysts” (most of them don’t deserve that title)\n\n**d. The “Cramer” Investors**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nDon’t invest based on ANYTHING you see being told on TV. IF Cramer told people to buy, don’t—unless you’ve done significant DD. As the saying goes—even a broken clock is right twice a day.\n\nPractical Example:  \nInverse Cramer… I am joking.\n\n**e. No such thing as “It has grown in the past, so it must continue to do so.”**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nAs the title says, past performance is almost never an indicator of future performance. A true investor’s indicator of future performance is an in-depth analysis.\n\nPractical Example:  \nAAPL has grown at a \\~27% CAGR in the past 20 years *so it must continue to do so*. - By that logic apple will have a higher market capitalization than all stock markets combined in 15 years.\n\n**f. When to sell - My mistakes**\n\nTheoretical Lesson:  \nThis links back to the two main types of investments. If you catch a cigar butt, the answer is simple. Sell at or slightly above fair value. But, in the case of “Buffett” Plays , they are to be sold only when there is an extreme bubble (trading >2.5 times fair value), when the moat is in danger, or when there is a serious personal need for money. In other words, they can be held “forever”.\n\nPractical Example:  \nAXP, GOOG, KO, AAPL.\n\nMy mistakes:  \nI confused the two types of plays. I have sold companies at +60-80% gain instead of holding out for Multibaggers (x3-10-100). My biggest mistakes are NVDA (I missed out on a x12 by selling at x2), CAT (x1.7 instead of x3.5), TSM (x1.4 instead of x2.1), META (x1.5 instead of x4), etc.\n\n# B. My 7 Key Plays during 2022-2025\n\n# B.1. The Plays\n\n1. GOOG\n2. NFLX\n3. META\n4. JPM\n5. TSM\n6. AXP\n7. CAT\n\n# B.2. Why?\n\nAll of them had one thing in common. They were undervalued based on multiple metrics, they were great business with solid growth prospects, their drop in stock price was due to reasons other than a true change in the day-to-day reality of their business operations. - There is LITERALLY nothing more to add. It’s pretty simple, you don’t need extremely complex formulas.\n\nS&P 2022 ; -\\~20% - This is the year that stocks went on sale\n\nDuring 2022 I was buying heavily, especially NFLX, GOOG and MSFT which dropped much more than the S&P. My key plays in 2022 gave me some very HARD lessons on losing money temporarily. These investments weren’t merely some fundamental analysis combined with analyzing management (through checking past promises and targets and seeing if they line up with reality and results), they were a test in emotion management. Because USD appreciated compared to my national currency and these stocks dropped a lot, I saw -35% one morning and I didn’t know what to do, so I just went for a 17 KM Run in a nearby managed forest (sort of like a park) and I took a long shower with a short 1 min cold bath and I stopped overthinking about whether I should or shouldn’t sell—in the following 3 months I recovered all my losses.\n\n# C. Similarities and Differences to 2022\n\n# C.1. Similarities\n\n**a. Tech Bubble**\n\nBoth in 2020-2021 and now there is a clear tech bubble, where multiples have expanded considerably, and now sit well above the historical averages. Of course, the reason (the motive for the bubble) is different. Moreover, the 2020-2021 bubble popped in 2022, and the 2024 bubble is slowly popping in 2025 (at least for now, it’s not impossible for it to reverse course).\n\n**b. Russian Aggression**\n\nThe Russo-Ukrainian war started on the 24th of February 2022 and it caused a widespread reaction throughout the world. It led to inflation, lower GDP growth in Europe, started recession fears in the US, etc.\n\nThe war is still ongoing and it is part of the Trump agenda, so it is still important, although its effects on the rest of the world have considerably died down.\n\n# C.2. Differences\n\n**a. Trump Tariffs**\n\nAlthough there were already tariffs on China, which Biden continued, they weren’t even close to the current scale. As of the time of writing, the tariffs stand at [145%](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/12/economy/toy-prices-us-china-tariffs/index.html). These are going to have a negative impact on inflation, the economy and the US’s status as a reliable trading partner. These are long term concerns that have immediate implications which may cause the US to go into a recession, or at least a bear market.\n\n**b. European “Trump Card”**\n\nTrump winning the election has definitely changed the trajectory of Europe and I believe that the EU is starting to wake up (although very slowly). Von der Leyen has until now [mostly delivered](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-first-100-days-graded-europe-nato-ukraine-war/) on her promises (first 100 days), which is much better than in the past. And all of her promises for the next 4 years give European stocks an ability to decouple from the us stock market performance (Capital markets union, defense union, deregulation, 28th regime, etc.), so you can find some interesting opportunities on the European markets as well.\n\n# D. 2025 - Value Ideas/Plays\n\n# D.1. Key Sector - Hidden Normalized FCF\n\nTech is hiding a lot of normalized FCF under its hood. I’ve already done an article on this topic and I’ve placed it 👇.\n\n\n\n# D.2. Similar Plays\n\nGOOG looks pretty interesting, although they have some problems with monopoly law, which should be kept in mind when doing DD. As for the rest of the 2025 plays, I believe we should still wait a bit more for them to drop, but in general most of the great plays are in tech, just like last time. (Don’t expect me to give you what stocks to invest in, I am not a guru)\n\n# D.3. New Boring Value (eg. BTI)\n\nBTI is my most recent cigar butt play and it demonstrates that “boring” value still exists in the market. Even in overvalued markets, you can still find value, you just have to build a keen sense of smell and have some patience. With the market dropping after Trump’s tariffs, I believe new boring value will appear, but the question is—should you choose to put your money in a quick cigar butt play or in a long term Buffett play?\n\n# E. Conclusion\n\nFocusing on true cash flow metrics and disciplined analysis is essential for investment success. Ignore market noise, understand company fundamentals, and manage emotions. Whether seeking quick value or long-term growth, patience and adaptability are the keys to strong returns.",

        "selftext": "Currently, NVIDIA ($NVDA) is the market leader, with a market cap reaching $3T, surpassing Microsoft ($MSFT) and nearing Apple ($AAPL). The main question on investors’ minds is, \"How much higher will it grow from here?\" \n\nHowever, there is a sense of nervousness in the air. NVIDIA’s stock has been declining since their fantastic earnings call. The reason, according to investors, is that its gross margin decreased from 78.4% to 75.1% quarter-over-quarter, with some of this decline attributed to issues in Blackwell chip manufacturing. Today, the stock further impacted the market by dropping 10%, wiping out $279 billion in market capitalization. \n\nAfter hours, two reports surfaced that shed light on the decline (whales likely knew and sold beforehand):\n\n1. A mystery customer, potentially Microsoft, accounted for 19% of Nvidia’s revenue last year, according to UBS (reported by Business Insider).\n\n2. Nvidia received a DOJ subpoena as part of an escalating antitrust probe, with subpoenas also sent to third parties in the case.\n\n[NVIDIA Performance Screenshot 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dMbKkf4OkbkZeQ9dxWuUHXn1e7iPCVxe/view?usp=share_link)\n\n[NVIDIA Performance Screenshot 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Td85sBZQMidroWUbn-2cqpH7jmKr64V4/view?usp=share_link)\n\nBased on NVIDIA’s ($NVDA) 10-Q, the company was already concerned about those two key issues: customer concentration and the risk of regulation.\n\nQuote from NVIDIA’s 10-Q:\n\n>\"We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors. We have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\"\n\n>[NVIDIA 10-Q Quote screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12PJkQCvHxgBzimNj1pUcGKeulBTNSSaP/view?usp=share_link)\n\n\n\nIf the company was already concerned about these issues, it means the risks are very real. \n\nIf the risk is real, and you hold NVIDIA ($NVDA), you have to ask yourself how to position yourself.\n\nHere are some important questions to consider:\n\n1 - Do you believe NVIDIA will become the first company to cross $4T in market cap despite these very real risks?\n\nThe answer is: we don’t know, but it’s not looking good.\n\n2 - Which company stands to benefit from an antitrust probe in the AI accelerator space?\n\n\n\n**A - Is it Intel ($INTC)? Probably not.** \n\nThis is a company that just laid off 15,000 employees and is losing money hand over fist, even with significant government subsidies (up to $8.5 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act, with an additional $11 billion in loans).\n\nAs of this writing, Intel is reportedly considering selling its Foundry business, which has been hemorrhaging money.\n\nRecent performance:\n\n• Q2 Revenue = $12.8 billion, down ⬇️ 1% YoY, up ⬆️ 1% QoQ\n\n• DCAI (Data Center and AI) – Revenue was flat sequentially and down 3% YoY (less revenue than last year ☹️)\n\n• The operating loss for the Intel Foundry business was $2.8 billion in Q2 2024, compared to $1.9 billion in Q2 2023. Year-to-date 2024, the operating loss was $5.3 billion, compared to $4.2 billion YTD 2023.\n\n[Intel Performance Screenshot -1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jmwqQa_Xo-CO0oCUenG3VrsC3GL9yNUf/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Intel Performance Screenshot -2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13dERGSZKxftrZ5IbKYiOcyVtRZXd8wrZ/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Intel Performance Screenshot -3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTjWq6djgA8UaHUsCC1GZL0MMM2oP69i/view?usp=sharing)\n\n  \n**B - Is it AMD ($AMD)? Maybe, or even probably.** \n\nLet’s take a look at the metrics:\n\n• Data Center: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year, driven by growth in AMD Instinct GPUs and EPYC server revenue, with a 21% QoQ increase.\n\nUnlike Intel, AMD is actually generating revenue from AI through its GPU and data center business.\n\nCurrently, AMD is valued at $221.63 billion. Is it overvalued? That’s hard to say. Is NVIDIA overvalued?\n\nTo wrap up, it’s clear that AMD still has room to grow.\n\n[AMD Performance Screenshot - 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y9Qd3O6P9oIZJCOwDPsV00v9AzkiBHCu/view?usp=sharing)\n\n  \n",

        "selftext": "holy shit this is long, will make another post about what I'm buying later\n\nI'm not usually this active but the valuation expansion in my portfolio is getting uncomfortable. I would love to be a high-conviction all-in on 1-3 stocks (like the HSY guy) but I don't think I can stomache it, maybe with some more experience. For now I tend to diversify over about 10-20 companies to protect myself from my own ignorance.\n\n# Selling\n\n* Disney (DIS) - I bought it primarily for its streaming business, with the parks and production segments as a stable foundation. I don't hate it don't love it, I just want to put money elsewhere. Management shuffling gives me lack of confidence, wall st likes Bob Igor but who knows how long he'll want to stick around. IMO he's not the right person to grow streaming, and neither was he previous successor. I don't know enough about the movie industry or parks to be invested in it.\n\n* Apple (AAPL) - A great company with great products, I've owned for years but EPS has been flat for the past 3 years. Last 2 years have been nothing but valuation expansion which is a good enough reason for me to trim/sell. They capitalize their R&D expenses (as they should according to GAAP) but it means their IRR (ROIC) which looks the same as other Mag7 companies (that don't capitalize R&D) is actually worse. They also have an outsized exposure to chinese trade risk. I think there are better opportunities at my meager scale. May pick back up if it goes down by 30% but I can't justify it in my portfolio at its current yields.\n\n# Reducing\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) - Similar to AAPL, except it still grows. Increasingly I don't like retail and its margins. AMZN is huge and retail margins are such that they need to go into negative cash flow to make any major investments. Their most recent investment in improving the logistics has worked out well (gj Jassy), arguably an impenetrable logistics moat. AWS is *the* leader but I think Azure has the better growth prospects, AWS cannabalizes its 3rd party vendors to grow which I don't think is very sustainable. Their ROIC isn't amazing and not managining dilution well. People have all sorts of rationalizations about why you shouldn't look at their ROIC, earnings or FCF because of how they do internal investments, but idc. It will probably do fine in the coming years, but if it turned into an IBM in 10-20 years I wouldn't be at all surprised. Not that IBM is a terrible company, I just can't justify its (or AMZN's) price right now, you do you.\n\n# Undecided - to sell\n\n* Warner Bros (WBD) - Bought primarily for its streaming business, recent restructure is promising but may also indicate a spin-off or selling of part of their business. If I could buy the streaming business on its own I would, as it is I have to take it together with its production segments that I can't properly value. It's cashflow basically comes from the depreciation of intangible assets. It's hard to know exactly what that refers to but other than film and tv content rights (which are itemized separately) it probably means network or dtc distribution agreements of sorts (maybe, idk). So it's far from being in a sustainable place. Probably going to exit next quarter depending on what happens with the reorg.\n\n# Unchanged\n\nMore than half of my portfolio is still Meta + Google which I'm not looking to change for the forseeable future. There's a lot that can be said about each and their respective competitive landscape, but the tldr is that their 30%+ ROIC (which is actually higher because they don't capitalize R&D), consistent profitability, eps growth and strong balance sheets justifies their price to me.",

Got me thinking: if stocks go sideways but earnings keep growing at the normal 6-8% per year, how long before valuations look normal again?\n\nDid the math and it's about 5-7 years of sideways action while earnings compound. Take Apple for example - they're at a P/E of 31 vs their historical 20 ([https://valuesense.io/ticker/aapl](https://valuesense.io/ticker/aapl)). If their stock price freezes but earnings keep growing at 10% annually, they'd be back to normal in about 4.5 years. Pretty wild, right?\n\nSome analysts are actually projecting 15% earnings growth for 2025, which would speed things up, but who knows with all these tariff threats and policy chaos floating around. Plus, let's be real - the market is basically 7 mega-cap tech companies (making up \\~30% of the index) and then everything else. Strip those out, and the rest of the market actually looks way more reasonably priced.\n\nI keep seeing this argument that we've got more retail investors than ever pumping money into the market, especially with how easy apps make it to invest now. Is this really creating a \"new normal\" for P/E ratios? Or is this just the same old \"this time it's different\" BS we always hear at market peaks?\n\nEven if no 20-year period has ever produced negative returns, a market that goes nowhere for 5+ years is still terrible for anyone buying in now. You're basically just losing to inflation the whole time.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this just simple math working itself out, or are we witnessing some fundamental shift in how markets are valued? And what the hell do we do with our portfolios if we're looking at half a decade of sideways action?",

Gross Margin must be > 40%\n2. SG&A Margin must be < 30%\n3. R&D Margin must be < 30%\n4. Interest Expense Margin must be < 15%\n5. Tax Margin must be in line with the current corporate tax rate of the company's country (\\~20% for the US)\n6. Net Income Margin must be > 20%\n7. EPS Growth must be positive and consistent\n\nHere is a video of Brian explaining these 7 rules: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTsnwBqq7S.\n\nI’d like to mention that I am in no way connected to Brian or his YouTube channel—I’m just a fan, like many other value investors.\n\nOn the other hand, I do run my own AI startup that helps financial analysts and long-term investors analyze financial reports like 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and earnings call reports. After watching his video, I decided to add these rules of thumb to our platform as AI prompts for analyzing 10-Ks and 10-Qs. The results have been promising, and I believe they might be useful to many investors who want to follow Warren Buffett’s strategies.\n\nIn the video, Brian used these rules to evaluate Apple’s stock (AAPL). I can confidently say that our AI arrived at the same conclusions as Brian after I applied these prompts to the latest AAPL 10-Q and 10-K reports.\n\nHere is are links to the results the AI produced on the latest Apple 10-K and 10-Q.

Elon Musk’s xAI released their version just days later with their newest Grok 3 reasoning model.\n\nAnd I’m no better than these copycat companies because I released a Deep Research alternative for EXTREMELY advanced, comprehensive financial analysis.\n\n# What’s the idea behind “Deep Research”?\n\nThe key idea behind Deep Research is laziness. Instead of doing the work to create a comprehensive report on a topic, you just use an LLM, and it will compile the report autonomously.\n\nUnlike the traditional usage of large language models, this process is somewhat asynchronous.\n\nWith it, you give deep research an extremely complex task, and then it will spend the next 2 to 20 minutes “thinking” and generating a report for your question.\n\nFor example, if we look at the comparison between GPT-4o and Deep Research, we can see that deep research creates a comprehensive report on iOS vs Android adoption rates over the past 10 years.\n\n[Pic: Deep Research page on the OpenAI website](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*UnNkEqvwTlip25dg4AKZ2Q.png)\n\nThis allows us to do hours of work within minutes. So being an algorithmic trader, I KNEW I had to make a Deep Research alternative for advanced stock analysis.\n\n# How would Deep Research be useful for stock analysis?\n\nIf you're a savvy investor, you already know the types of things that goes into comprehensive financial analysis. This includes:\n\n* Thoroughly reviewing income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows from 10-Q and 10-K reports\n* Real-time sentiment analysis of recent company news\n* Monitoring trading volumes and stock price fluctuations\n* Analyzing similar companies or a company’s closest competitors\n\nDoing all of this one after the other is ridiculously time-consuming. Hell, I might as well just invest in SPY and call it a day; I mean, who has time for all of that? But imagine… just close your eyes and *imagine* if you could click a button and get ALL of the information you could ever need about a stock.\n\nNow open your eyes and keep following along because now we literally can.\n\n# Introducing NexusTrade Deep Dive (DD)\n\nI named the alternative to Deep Research “DD” for a specific reason. In investing, when you do research on a stock, we call that doing your due diligence. Now DD has a new meaning.\n\nDeep Dive is a one-click solution to performing some of the most advanced due diligence from an AI model. With a single button click, you get a comprehensive report that:\n\n* Analyzes recent price trends and possible anomalies\n* Examine financial metrics for the past 4 years and the past 4 quarters\n* Interprets recent news and the possible impact on the stock price\n* Conducts a comprehensive SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)\n\nFor example, let’s say I’m an AI enthusiast interested in NVIDIA stock. NVIDIA recently fell after its earnings, and I’m wondering if it’s a good idea to lower my cost average or bail on the play.\n\nTraditional stock analysis would take hours. I would have to Google the stock, read news articles about it, look at their earnings statements, find their competitors, and finally come to a decision.\n\nBut now, here’s the DD on NVIDIA. Powered by AI. [And here’s the PDF of the document, which you can download after generating a report.](https://nexustrade-prod.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/NVDA_DeepResearch_Report.pdf)\n\n[The DD report on NVIDIA (downloadable in NexusTrade)](https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https%3A//nexustrade-prod.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/NVDA_DeepResearch_Report.pdf&embedded=true)\n\n# NVIDIA’s Deep Dive (DD) powered by NexusTrade\n\n[Pic: A PDF of NexusTrade’s Deep Dive Report](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*EUpyqQ8B_NIISmaOthtAGg.png)\n\n**Report Summary**\n\nWith the click of a button, we have this comprehensive PDF report on NVIDIA. It starts with an **executive summary**. This summary explains the entire report, and gives an **investment thesis** that explains why someone might want to hold the stock. Finally, it concludes, risk rating for the stock and a detailed explanation for why it was given that.\n\n**Price Performance Analysis**\n\nAfter the executive summary comes the **price performance analysis.** This section gives us recent price information about NVIDIA for the last 4 years. We can see how NVIDIA has moved recently, and it’s overall trend in price movement.\n\n[Pic: Seeing NVIDIA’s change in price and technical analysis insights](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*sq_DJqzwyLNdvQ7o-m_uLA.png)\n\nThis is cool. For example, while we might be bummed that NVIDIA hasn’t moved much in the past 3 months, we’re reminded that it has moved a ridiculous amount in the past few years. This is always a great reminder for investors holding the stock.\n\n**Fundamental Analysis**\n\nHowever, what’s more interesting than the price analysis is the fundamental analysis. With this section, we get to understanding exactly how strong and healthy the stock’s underlying business actually is.\n\nWe start by looking at its quarter-over-quarter and annual performance.\n\n[Pic: Looking at the financial performance of NVIDIA stock](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*AqChgo-B2mI4sOVOblXt5w.png)\n\nThis is useful to understand the company’s financial stability, liquidity position, and overall fiscal health.\n\n[Pic: Looking at the cash flow of NVIDIA](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*wASGx3fkgVTtSDyIv2ADLg.png)\n\nWith this, we’re not just trading stocks; we’re buying shares of a business, and this information helps us decide if the business is worth investing in or not.\n\nAfter this, we get to another fun section – comparing the stock to its biggest competitors.\n\n# Competitive Comparison\n\n[Pic: Comparing NVIDIA to its peers](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lJ29ivB0tIjdBC1c9zV4XQ.png)\n\nAfter analyzing the fundamentals of NVIDIA, we also analyze some of its biggest industry peers. In this case, we’re analyzing AMD, Broadcom, Intel, Microsoft, Google, and Meta.\n\nWe have a very nice, readable chart that compares key metrics, such as revenue growth, net margin, ROE, P/E ratio, and more. With this, we can quickly see why NVIDIA rose to a $3 trillion market cap. When we compare it to other stocks like AMD, its extremely clear which one is fundamentally stronger and has a lower valuation.\n\nAfter we’re done looking at NVIDIA’s fundamentals, we can then explore its sentiment, and why it has been in the news recently.\n\n# Recent News Analysis\n\n[Pic: Looking at the recent news for NVIDIA](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*9YHQPcNy7nnKoFZSbh1r9A.png)\n\nAfter examining NVIDIA’s fundamentals and comparing it to competitors, the next crucial section is the News Analysis. This section provides valuable context about recent events that could impact the stock’s performance.\n\nIn the case of NVIDIA, we can see that the DD report analyzes recent news coverage, including earnings reports, CEO statements, and market reactions. This analysis helps investors understand the narrative surrounding the company and how it might influence investor sentiment and stock price.\n\nFor example, the report highlights NVIDIA’s strong Q4 FY2025 performance with 78% year-over-year revenue growth, as well as CEO Jensen Huang’s comments about next-generation AI requiring significantly more computing power. These insights provide forward-looking indicators of potential demand growth for NVIDIA’s products.\n\nNews analysis is essential because markets often react to headlines before fully digesting the underlying fundamentals. By examining recent news systematically, investors can separate signal from noise and make more informed decisions.\n\n# Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats Section\n\n[Pic: The SWAT section for the article](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*0xm6gt7MbTHCogVPap8fkg.png)\n\nOne of the most comprehensive parts of the DD report is the SWOT analysis, which provides a structured framework for evaluating NVIDIA’s competitive position:\n\nThe Strengths section highlights NVIDIA’s dominant market position (like its 80–90% market share in AI accelerators), exceptional financial performance (114.20% annual revenue growth), and technological leadership with its GPU architectures.\n\nThe Weaknesses section acknowledges potential vulnerabilities, including dependency on the AI boom, premium valuation that leaves little margin for error, and the impact of export controls on NVIDIA’s China business.\n\nThe Opportunities section identifies growth areas such as expanding AI applications, automotive growth, and enterprise AI adoption across industries.\n\nThe Threats section outlines challenges like intensifying competition from AMD, Intel, and startups, regulatory challenges, and potential macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nThis SWOT analysis is invaluable for investors because it moves beyond raw financial data to provide strategic context. It helps answer the crucial question of whether a company’s competitive advantages are sustainable, and what factors could disrupt its business model in the future.\n\n# Conclusion and Investment Outlook\n\nThe final section ties everything together with a forward-looking investment recommendation. This holistic summary helps investors understand whether all the data points to a compelling investment case.\n\nFor NVIDIA, the report concludes with a balanced perspective: strong fundamentals support the company’s premium valuation, but investors should remain aware of risks like competition, regulatory challenges, and the company’s vulnerability to geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe report provides a 12-month price target range ($135-$160) and a risk rating (Medium), giving investors concrete parameters to guide their decision-making. This clear assessment is what makes Deep Dive reports so valuable compared to traditional stock research methods.\n\n# Why Deep Dive Analysis Matters\n\nWhat makes the Deep Dive approach revolutionary is its comprehensiveness and efficiency. Traditional fundamental analysis requires investors to spend hours gathering information from multiple sources — financial statements, news articles, competitive analysis, and technical charts. The DD report consolidates all this information into a single, coherent document that can be generated in minutes.\n\nFor retail investors who lack the time or resources to conduct exhaustive research, this democratizes access to high-quality financial analysis. It provides a structured framework for evaluating stocks beyond simple metrics like P/E ratios or revenue growth.\n\nAs AI continues to transform the financial industry, tools like NexusTrade’s Deep Dive represent the future of investment research — comprehensive, data-driven, and accessible with a single click. Whether you’re evaluating established giants like NVIDIA or researching promising newcomers, the DD framework provides the structured analysis needed to make informed investment decisions in today’s complex market environment.\n\nBy turning hours of research into minutes of reading, Deep Dive analysis doesn’t just save time — it fundamentally changes how investors can approach due diligence in the age of AI.\n\nWant to try Deep Dive for yourself?

        "title": "Deepseek’s Impact on FAANG+: A Value Investor’s Perspective",
        "selftext": "**Microsoft (MSFT)** \n\nMicrosoft is by far the biggest buyer of NVIDIA chips thanks to its OpenAI partnership – which also makes it the most exposed to the DeepSeek open-source model release. Commoditization (and dirt-cheap pricing) of these models directly undermines OpenAI’s value proposition and the existing infrastructure Microsoft’s built. The stock could drop sharply, especially if users flee OpenAI for free alternatives like DeepSeek, jeopardizing their joint venture. Remember: Microsoft’s $10B OpenAI investment relies on profit-sharing to pay off, and that math gets trickier as AI becomes commoditized.That said, all isn’t lost. Satya Nadella – the *King of Open Source* – has pivoted Microsoft brilliantly before. His playbook? Embrace, don’t fight, the wave. A few examples: **Bottom line**: Nadella understands open source’s power better than anyone. While Microsoft’s heavy OpenAI/Infra bets look shaky short-term, Azure could pivot to dominate the *commoditized* AI future. They’re poised to offer open-source models as APIs (like \"R1\" or others) and integrate cheaper, leaner models into their own products – slashing costs while keeping enterprise customers hooked.Short-term? MSFT might stumble if OpenAI falters. Long-term? Azure becomes the *Walmart of AI models* – lower margins, but massive volume. Any stock dip here is a buying opportunity.\n\n   * Dumping Internet Explorer for Chromium-based Edge\n   * Open-sourcing Visual Studio Code (now the #1 developer IDE)\n   * GitHub Copilot: Originally OpenAI-powered, but Satya wisely expanded it to support Anthropic’s models too, making it more versatile.\n\n**Alphabet (GOOGL)**\n\nGoogle’s search business faces daily threats from AI startups like OpenAI, Perplexity, and DeepSeek – all offering competing search tools. This is *very* bearish for the stock, especially if user attrition accelerates. Alphabet bought fewer NVIDIA chips than other hyperscalers, leaning instead on its cost-effective TPU ASICs and in-house AI models. But their late, botched rollout in the AI race left their models lagging behind DeepSeek and OpenAI in popularity. Even their Gemini lineup hasn’t sparked much developer excitement.\n\nThe silver lining? Google’s scrambling to catch up. They’re integrating AI responses directly into search results – a move that risks cannibalizing search ad revenue but could help retain users. Their ad network remains unmatched (thanks to cash cows like AdSense, AdMob, YouTube and Gmail, which aren’t threatened by AI… yet). Right now, Google’s survival hinges on keeping users glued to its ecosystem *at all costs*.\n\nLong-term, I’m cautious – particularly on their ad business. I’ll be watching search revenue trends like a hawk to gauge if the stock’s worth buying. That said, Alphabet’s entrenched ad dominance means any short-term, panic-driven sell-off could be a golden chance to scoop up shares. \n\n**Amazon (AMZN)**\n\nAmazon is known for doubling down on \"frugal\" culture – they’re all about doing more with less, cutting fluff, and pushing self-reliance (it’s literally one of their leadership principles). That’s why this DeepSeek R1 news makes sense for AWS adoption since it was trained at a fraction of the cost. Don’t forget, Amazon is already making their own AI chips – Trainium (training) and Inferentia (inference) – which screams efficiency and capital discipline. Plus, AWS could host not just Amazon’s proprietary models but also serve up open-source options like R1. In the long-term, I am bullish. Short-term, there might be a negligible bearish sentiment about their Anthropic investment looking shaky against DeepSeek. \n\n**Tesla (TSLA)**\n\nTesla might see a small correction too, but not because of DeepSeek – their business and AI focus are totally different. If you think about it, this is actually bullish for Tesla, especially if NVIDIA ends up slashing GPU prices. Tesla could get way more bang for their buck. \n\n**Meta Platforms (META)**\n\nMeta’s the biggest winner in this whole debacle. Their goal with releasing open-source Llama models was always to commoditize AI and avoid getting left behind in case of a breakthrough. Well, DeepSeek just delivered that breakthrough. There’s speculation that R1 is already better than the upcoming Llama 4 model. Now, Meta gets to release an even better open-source model that they can also use internally. While all this sounds bullish for Meta, investors still haven’t seen clear revenue signals from all this Capex. Long-term, if tangible revenue doesn’t materialize, investors might sell the stock – just like they did in the past with all the metaverse Capex. Overall, I’m neutral on Meta in the short term but slightly bullish in the long term.\n\n**Apple (AAPL)**\n\nAs you know, Apple’s execution in the AI field has been downright underwhelming. The company faces its own problems, like slumping iPhone sales in China. On top of that, Apple is the least aggressive spender in this sector – no crazy AI investments reported, no partnership with NVIDIA for training their models. They are even renting cheaper Google Cloud TPUs instead of building their own infrastructure. So any Apple correction tied to this news would likely be minimal or unrelated. That said, the stock could dip broadly due to negative market sentiment. I’m staying NEUTRAL for now – but if we get an overdone sell-off? I would eye it as a BUY.\n\n[Read full article here...](https://www.stockstrends.ai/p/is-deepseek-a-signal-of-the-top-for)",

        "title": "$CART Stock is a Compounding Machine - Here’s Why",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone, the following analysis is one I actually wrote back in January but I feel it’s still relevant today. Instacart is an incredible business and I’ve been surprised I haven’t heard anything about it from other investors. All I ask is that you read with an open mind, thank you.\n\n\nMaplebear (Instacart) (CART)\n\nInstacart can be classified as an exponential compounding company. This company has impressed me over and over with its incredible resilience in the face of apparent mounting competition and its ability to produce precipitously growing yet consistent free cash flow (FCF) per share. Let's take a look at the qualities of this business and what exactly will make it outperform the market over the long term.\n\nMoat: When I’m looking to purchase a business I ask myself “Will this business get stronger in times of crises?”. Instacart was a business that in the most recent crises that was Covid-19 certainly got stronger, the company gained market share, expanded margins, and grew at a steep rate. In a time where people were fearful of leaving their home, Instacart was perfectly positioned to capitalize by delivering people the vital things they needed while also providing brick and mortar retailers with the resources they needed to serve customers. \nIn terms of the business’s moat, I would describe it as being an “Additive Layer”. So what is an Additive Layer in the context of this company's moat? As mentioned previously, Instacart offers products to traditional brick and mortar retail companies to help them enhance their businesses such as E-Commerce Solutions, Fulfillment Solutions, Connective Store Technology, and Advertising Solutions. When a traditional brick and mortar retailer utilizes even just one of these products (but oftentimes more than one product) it becomes part of their business, it offers so much new value to these very traditional businesses that they can't live without it. This appealing value proposition from Instacart makes its enterprise software extremely sticky. On the Q3 2024 earnings call Instacart CEO Fidji Simo cited the integration of Instacart technology into other businesses as a hugely influential factor to Instacart's future growth when she said “These integrations remain one of the most under-appreciated parts of our business and are really our secret sauce”. Right there in the earnings call the CEO is calling out the businesses ability to entrench itself in another business as being “under-appreciated” which is a key indicator of undervaluation by investors.\n\nYield: Assuming a 10-year risk free rate of 5% from the U.S. Treasury, we can use this 5% rate as a benchmark to value Instacart. The closer Instacart's free cash flow yield is to 5% then the greater the possibility that the company could be at a reasonable valuation. As of January 9th, 2024 Instacart's free cash flow yield adjusted for the 51.08% in dilutive Stock Based Compensation (SBC) is 2.96%. This yield is nothing spectacular but if you were to ignore the very real expense of SBC then the free cash flow yield shoots up to 6.05%. Now of course I’m not suggesting SBC can be ignored but if we take a look at Instacart's Q3 2024 earnings call we see that Instacart's CFO Emily Reuter had said “In Q4, we also anticipate SBC will begin to normalize now that we have lapped our IPO quarter”. So the management is directly telling us that SBC will continue a downward trend and judging from the SBC difference between Q2 of 2024 of 465.37% and Q3 of 2024 of 51.08% I feel strongly that we will continue to see a normalization of SBC. Assuming the current SBC is cut in half next quarter (a conservative estimate) and FCF has zero growth (extremely unlikely) then that would make the SBC adjusted FCF yield 4.50%, an extremely attractive number for such a great company and that's without the share buybacks of which Instacart will continue to be aggressive with implementing. So even though the current SBC on paper is 2.96%, we can make a safe estimate that it's actually closer to 4.50% and likely much higher. In the long term I expect Instacart's SBC to normalize to the high single digits and stay relatively stable apart from small variations (low to mid-single digit percentage differences) every Q2 due to the timing of Instacarts annual equity refresh grants.\n\n\nGrowth: With a 2 year average trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue growth rate of 20.56% and a 1 year average TTM growth rate of 10.08% Instacart has proven it has the ability to provide attractive revenue growth. Although revenue growth isn’t necessarily one of the most important factors in a business it is one worthy of being considered. What I see as arguably the most important factor in valuing a stock is the growth of FCF per share. This is the most important factor because it can tell us how much cash the business produces that can be readily distributed back to shareholders through buybacks and/or dividends. Instacart has grown its FCF per share at a dizzying rate of 100% over the past TTM, likewise the stock has risen 95.12% in the past year, an almost perfect match, this is a trend you’ll see in almost all public companies. I expect the FCF per share growth to continue at a less precipitous but still impressive rate for the foreseeable future due to Instacart's ability to produce abundant and growing amounts of FCF, their ongoing aggressive buyback program, and shrinking levels of SBC. The rate at which Instacart has returned capital over the past year has been truly astounding. In Q3 of 2023 they had a total of 0$ in share repurchases and only a year later in Q3 of 2024 they had completed a total of $3.297 Billion with the amount of repurchases rising steeply each quarter. \n\nCapital Efficiency: The capital efficiency of a company is a crucial key to assessing the viability of a company. A company’s efficiency is measured by its return on capital employed (ROCE). You want a company to have a ROCE of over 8%. Any company with a ROCE annual percentage under 8% is a capital destroyer.\nExcluding the yet to be reported Q4 of 2024, Instacart so far has a ROCE in 2024 of 10.85% and this figure will almost certainly rise when the final quarter of the year is reported. This percentage is more than adequate and tells me that the management of Instacart can be counted on to utilize its capital efficiently. It’s worthy of note that Instacart had a one time drastic decrease in ROCE in Q3 of 2023 to -65.73% due solely to its initial public offering (IPO), the quarter after this decrease ROCE returned to normal levels. As Instacart continues to scale and integrate itself into other businesses I expect to see the ROCE levels rise gradually over time.\n\n\n\nMargins: Instacart has impressively high gross margins, in Q3 of 2024 Instacart had a gross margin of 75.23%, that's higher than companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG),(GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The average gross \nmargin for public companies across all industries is 36%, so Instacart has over double the average gross margin. In addition to its extremely high gross margin, Instacart has also been growing this margin at an impressive and steady rate, in Q1 of 2021 the gross margin was 65.5%, representing some very impressive growth. This gross margin growth has also been relatively steady with small ebbs and flows overtime but continuing the relative uptrend. With an operating margin of 16.2% and a profit margin of 13.85%, (both of which are above average relative to all industries) this is yet another fundamental metric that Instacart continues to excel in. I expect to see gross margin, operating margin, and profit margin expand overtime gradually as the business continues to grow.\n\n\nBalance Sheet: Instacart is in an extremely strong financial position with $1.44 billion in cash, $28 million in capital leases, and just $16 million in debt. Even if you were to consider capital leases debt that still leaves Instacart in great financial shape. Since Instacart has so much cash from its operations just sitting around, we’ve seen them funneling this cash into aggressive share buybacks in the past few quarters and have likewise seen that cash position fall gradually. Instacart has never held large amounts of capital leases or debt which tells me the management can be trusted to properly manage the companies finances.\n\nExpenses: Instacart's overall expenses in any given normal operating quarter has remained modest, that being said from Q3 of 2023 to Q2 of 2024 expenses as a whole were elevated with the biggest acceleration in R&D (Research & Development). These sustained levels of increased expenses were due solely to impacts from Instacart's IPO and have normalized as of Q3 of 2024. The most important expenses I try to keep an eye out for are Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and R&D. Normally I like to see both R&D and CAPEX making up only a small percentage of the company’s market cap, in this case the sum of both expenses makes up only 6.24% of the current market cap, a good number for this company. Coming from the perspective of someone that generally looks for asset light companies with limited R&D and CAPEX spending, Instacart looks to be a solid investable candidate. \n\nCompetition: Like almost every company in the world Instacart faces competition. Although Instacart does face intense competition mainly from big, established companies like Uber (UBER) and Doordash (DASH, I believe Instacart has key advantages and qualities that uniquely position it to prosper. Overall Instacart has better margins, better rates of ROCE, better history of returning capital back to shareholders, a better balance sheet, and revenue growth on par with that of Uber (UBER). But more importantly I’ve seen how Instacart has entrenched itself in brick and mortar retail companies, creating a more effective ecosystem and therefore creating more value for these retailers.\n\nKey Takeaways: At its core I believe Instacart's future will be reliant not necessarily on grocery delivery but on its ability to integrate itself and more importantly its technology into the brick and mortar retail market. This integration will come in the form of both software solutions like Carrot AI and physical solutions like Caper Carts. The Integration will also come in the form of direct partnerships with popular retailers, we’ve seen this taking place for some time as Instacart has partnered with companies like Shoprite and Costco (COST). Overall, I believe Instacart to be a company with unique qualities that will continue to be a compounding machine into the foreseeable future and will continue to return cash flows back to investors at a vigorous rate.\n",

It's lovely to see that I have not lost all of you! This next project was meant as a single short write-up on the great monopolistic business of stock exchanges. To introduce the topic, this crash course of sorts would cover the topics of history, the types of exchanges, the business models, the variety, the regulatory framework, differences around the world, etc. However, as I started putting pen to paper, the piece got very long and gained a life of its own. Therefore, I decided to break the work into multiple pieces instead of narrowing it down and sacrificing valuable explanations for those exploring these topics for the first time. For those already familiar with the topic, feel free to open the section that interests you or await for the next write-up (on a specific exchange coming soon!), For the rest of you, I will try my best not to lose you all. I will try to explain it, bring relatable examples, and keep it shortish. P.S. A full PDF can be found HERE. Sections can be found in the PDF:\n\n1. Introduction\n2. What is an Exchange & Instruments\n3. History\n4. Major Players\n5. Exchange Options\n6. Business Models\n7. Conclusions\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI believe we are fortunate to be living in the 21st century with access to capital markets. Every day, there are trillions of dollars worth of transactions that flow through the world's exchanges. Money flows from one pair of hands to another, changing ownership of assets in what is truly the epitome of capitalism: the exchange, the single most influential entry for business. \n\nThese marketplaces sit at the very heart of our economic system. They help capitalism work by connecting those who need capital with those who have it to invest. They fund businesses, allow everybody to participate in the miracle of capitalism, and give everyone a chance at ownership of the best assets humanity has created. \n\nAs Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once observed, the stock market has evolved to become a window into the economy itself. This powerful leading indicator reflects not just where we are but where we're collectively heading. It's no coincidence that economists, policymakers, and business leaders observe market movements carefully. The activity on the exchanges illustrates the aggregated opinion of all the participants who make billions of decisions a day. \n\nMost of us interact with these markets directly or indirectly. For example, our retirement funds are invested in stocks and bonds traded on these exchanges. University endowments, charitable foundations, pension funds, insurance companies – virtually all major financial institutions place significant portions of their capital in markets. There's a deep, fundamental relationship between these exchanges and the broader economy, each factor influencing the other in a complex dance that affects everyone. \n\nThese exchanges are the cornerstones of capitalism, the foundations upon which modern economies are built. Yet, how many of us have ever stopped to think: What is a stock exchange, really? How does it actually work? Do we need it? Who controls it? Does the government influence it? Following this train of thought, let's dive deeper into our curiosity about why we use exchanges at all. How do exchanges enable these massive, complex operations? How do the actual exchanges themselves make money? And did you know that many of these exchange operators are publicly traded companies that you can own? \n\nOver the next few write-ups, we're going to study the business of exchanges. We will try to build a foundation upon which we can uncover these secrets. We'll examine several of the publicly traded exchange operators and understand whether you should consider these amazing businesses for your own investment portfolio. \n\nIn the CliffsNotes version of this piece, I formulate the opinion that exchanges are fascinating businesses with characteristics Warren Buffett has always loved – wide moats (significant competitive advantage), network effects (think snowball rolling down a hill the bigger you get, the faster you roll), capital-light operations (doesn't need a lot of money to keep business running) and tollbooth-like economics (unavoidable fee collection). Once established, exchanges tend to enjoy natural monopolies or oligopolies, creating enduring competitive advantages. \n\nUnlike most businesses that must reinvent themselves to stay relevant, stock exchanges have existed for centuries while maintaining the same essential function: efficiently bringing buyers and sellers together. For example, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, founded in 1602, would be recognizable in purpose (if not in technology) to a modern trader on the New York Stock Exchange. \n\nWhat makes exchanges particularly interesting from an investment perspective is that they combine the stability of essential infrastructure with growth opportunities in new financial products, data services, and geographic expansion. They're positioned at the crossroads of nearly every major economic trend. \n\nSo join me as we explore this business that sits at the very foundation of our capitalist system – the business of making markets. We'll look at how exchanges evolved, how they operate today, how they make money, the regulatory frameworks they navigate, and ultimately, whether they might deserve a place in your portfolio. \n\nWhat is a an Exchange? \n\nAt its most basic level, an exchange is a marketplace where securities—stocks, bonds, options, futures, and other financial instruments (more on them in a bit)—are bought and sold. But unlike the farmer's market, where you can see the vegetables and haggle with the seller, exchanges deal in ownership rights that exist primarily as electronic records where you constantly have buyers and sellers exchanging at a price. \n\nFor example, when you see a stock price displayed on your screen, say, Apple (AAPL) at $212.53, what you're actually seeing is the price at which the last recorded public transaction transpired. This \"last price\" is simply a record of what someone was willing to pay and someone else was willing to accept for a share of Apple at a specific moment in time. The other prices you may see are bid and asks; \n - The bid is the highest price a buyer is currently willing to pay for a share \n - The ask (or offer) is the lowest price a seller is currently willing to accept \n - The difference between these two is called the spread \n\nThis spread might be just a penny for highly liquid (high number of transactions in a short time) stocks like Apple. It could be substantial for thinly traded stocks (stocks that change hands rarely). The exchanges maintain an \"order book\" that lists all the bids and asks, creating a marketplace where buyers and sellers meet. \n\nMajor Exchanges Around the World The world's stock exchanges vary enormously in size, with the largest dwarfing the smallest: \n\n - New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) - The world's largest exchange by market capitalisation, hosting over 2,300 companies valued at over $25 trillion. \n - NASDAQ - The second-largest exchange, home to many technology giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. \n - Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) - The largest in Asia, listing over 3,700 companies. \n - Shanghai Stock Exchange - China's largest exchange and one of the most restrictive for foreign investors. \n - Euronext - A pan-European exchange operating markets in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, Oslo, Milan, and Paris. \n - London Stock Exchange (LSE) - One of Europe's oldest exchanges and a financial center. \n - Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) - A critical link between mainland China and international investors. \n - Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) - Canada's largest, particularly strong in natural resources and mining. \n\nThere are many others around the globe. Some exchanges focus on commodities, some on bonds, and some are full-fledged ecosystems. \n\nTypes of Exchanges\n\nExchanges have evolved dramatically over the centuries, but we can broadly categorise modern exchanges into two different types: \n\nFloor-Based Exchanges - The Farmers' Market of Stocks \n\nWhen you think of the stock market with traders running, yelling, and flashing lights as depicted in movies, you are thinking of Floor-Based Exchanges. Floor-based exchanges operate on similar principles as farmers' markets. Picture traders in their colourful jackets, shouting and waving their arms to buy and sell stocks, like farmers bargaining over the price of corn or apples. On a traditional trading floor: \n - Designated market makers (formerly called specialists) are assigned specific stocks, and the parallel in a farmers' market would be each stall owner. \n - Floor brokers execute trades on behalf of clients; on a farmers' market, this would be the customers passing the stalls. \n- Open outcry (hand signals and verbal bids) was traditionally used, which is what you are familiar depicted in movies. \n\nThe image of traders in colourful jackets shouting orders, running from one end to the next and chaos on the floor is historical mainly at this point. Even the NYSE (the most famous example of a floor-based exchange) floor is now primarily a television studio with some minimal trading functions rather than the chaotic scenes depicted in movies. The main reason? It's simply more efficient, accurate, reliable, faster and less chaotic to let computers execute the trades. As volumes rose (amount of trades happening) and technology improved, floor traders became obsolete.\n\nElectronic Exchanges - The Amazon.com of Trading\n\nAs floor-based exchange became obsolete, computers and algorithms took over the main functions. These exchanges are called electronic exchanges. Think of them like an Amazon.com of the exchange world; every action is done faster than you can snap your fingers. Most modern exchanges are fully electronic, including: \n- NASDAQ - Never had a trading floor, pioneering the electronic model \n- Euronext Operates a fully electronic trading platform \n- Most newer exchanges worldwide - Built on electronic models from inception \n\nIn electronic exchanges, computer systems match buyers and sellers automatically. This fact means unlike on floor-based exchanges where trades could take minutes, they occur in milliseconds. Moreover, you don't need to rely on contacting a trader to place an order; you just need a screen! \n\nThis shift to electronic trading has dramatically increased the speed and volume of transactions while reducing costs. The NYSE might execute over 3 billion shares on a typical day, a volume that would have been unimaginable in the era of purely manual trading. That said, I'll tip my hat to the old days. There's something special about the human touch, the energy of a trading floor in full swing and watching the recording of the chaos on the floor it just makes it feel a lot more real. But when you're handling today's markets, you need something that can keep up. It's like choosing between a horse-drawn carriage and a Ferrari. Both will get you there, but one's a lot quicker and doesn't need a barn. \n\nBeyond the Mechanics \n\nWhile the technical operation of exchanges is fascinating, it's important to remember their fundamental economic role. Exchanges provide: \n\n 1. Price discovery - Helping determine what assets are truly worth \n 2. Liquidity - Making it possible to convert investments to cash quickly \n 3. Capital formation - Allowing companies to raise money from the public \n 4. Wealth creation and distribution - Enabling ordinary people to own pieces of successful businesses \n\nWhen you see a stock price flash across your screen, remember that behind that simple number is an intricate system bringing together buyers and sellers from around the world. This system has evolved over centuries, yet it still serves its core purpose: creating a fair, efficient marketplace where capital can flow to its most productive uses. One key feature that distinguishes exchanges from other trading platforms is the central book—and here's why that matters. \n\nWhat Is a Central Book? \n\nThe central book (often called the central limit order book) is a centralized system that records all buy and sell orders for a specific security, like a stock. Picture it as a giant, real- time list, diary, or, more accurately, a ledger: every bid to buy and every offer to sell is logged, and orders are matched based on two simple rules—price and time. The highest bid and lowest ask are collected (see above for definitions) and get priority, and if two orders have the same price, the one placed first goes through. This setup ensures that the exchanges are transparent (everyone sees the same information) and fair (no one jumps the line unfairly). \n\nWhy Does the Central Book Set Exchanges Apart? \n\nUnlike other trading platforms—say, over-the-counter (OTC) (more on this later) markets, where trades can happen privately between parties (parties agree on a price for a transaction)—stock exchanges with a central book offer a single, unified marketplace. Meaning the exact same \"screen\" for everyone. This difference brings some big advantages: \n - Better Liquidity: With all buyers and sellers in one place, it's easier to find a match, reducing drastic price swings. \n - Fairer Prices: Everyone sees the same bids and offers, so there's no room for hidden deals or price discrepancies. \n - More Efficiency: Thanks to the organized system, trades are executed quickly and at the best available prices. \n\nThis centralized approach is a huge reason why stock exchanges have been the backbone of global trading for centuries. They've fine-tuned the art of transforming the chaos of buying and selling into an orderly, reliable process. In our following sections, we'll explore how these exchanges generate revenue, how they're regulated, and why they might make interesting investment opportunities themselves. \n\nTypes of Instruments \n\nNow, I am sure many of you are familiar with the variety of instruments you may encounter in a marketplace, but let's humour me for a moment and try to apply these instruments to a real-life example. \n\nFor the purposes of this explanation, let's say we are taking over an old bookstore called Old Books INC (I know, very original name) from a family friend. We bought their business and got 100% ownership! What did we buy? We purchased a small store that sells stationery items (such as paper, pens, ink, pencils, cards) and books. \n\nNow that we are the proud owner of Old Book INC we have the ambition to build an online retailer to rival Amazon! We have a vision of how we can help develop the business, but we realize we need capital to make that fact a reality. How can we ever raise the necessary capital? \n\n1. Equity \n\nOption 1: Sell a Piece of the Business. \n\nOne way you can raise the necessary capital is to sell a piece of your business. You see this on shows like Shark Tank, where business owners offer a piece of their business for cash; for example, \"we are asking for $100,000 for 25% of the business.\" This process is the selling of equity in your company. Equity comes from the Latin \"aequitas,\" meaning fairness or equality. In finance, it represents a fair claim to ownership. \n\nThere are a few different ways you can sell equity: \n\n - Common Stock: This is the most fundamental form of ownership. If you sold common stock in Old Books INC., buyers would become partial owners with voting rights on major decisions like electing the board of directors. If the bookstore chain becomes profitable, these shareholders might receive dividends – a portion of the profits. If Old Books INC. eventually gets acquired by Barnes & Noble (or Chapters in Canada) for twice its current value, common shareholders would see their investment double. \n - Preferred Stock: Some investors may want more certainty than common stock offers. You could issue preferred stock that promises a fixed 5% annual dividend, paid before any dividends go to common stockholders. These investors might be sacrificing their voting rights. Still, they get first dibs on any profits distributed and, in case of bankruptcy, would be ahead of common shareholders in any sale distributions. \n - Warrants: Some investors may be hesitant to invest in you right now; however, they like your ambition and would like the option to invest in you in the future. They can pay a fee and you would issue warrants that give the investor the right to buy additional shares at today's prices anytime in the next five years. If Old Books INC. turns around and the share price triples, these warrants become very valuable. \n - Rights: If you need a quick capital injection (putting cash into the business) later, you could issue rights to existing shareholders, allowing them to buy additional shares at a 15% discount – rewarding them for their loyalty while raising needed funds. \n\nNotes: Equity instruments are foundational to stock exchanges, traded on platforms like the NYSE or NASDAQ. \n\n2. Bonds (Fixed Income) \nOption 2: \n\nGet a Loan What if you don't want to sell your ownership of Old Book INC? Well, you can always get a loan. You gather your business plans, projections, and bank account information and head to the bank. You sit down with the representative and share your grandiose plans. The representative seems really into it—they give you a big smile, offer you a coffee, and tell you they've got your back. They head upstairs to hash out the final details with their manager. You sit there, proud and happy, your vision inching closer to reality. The representative comes back and says, \"Done deal! We're so excited to help you out—just sign here.\" You read over the terms, and the bank offers you a loan with an interest rate of 25% over 5 years! You're shocked. You can't accept this deal—it's simply too much. If you borrow $100,000, you'd have to pay $225,540 by the end of the loan! Dejected, you leave the bank and start thinking of a new plan. You have a solid reputation in the neighbourhood, along with friends and family, so you decide to get a loan from the public —this is a bond. The term \"bond\" comes from the Old English \"band,\" referring to something that binds or connects—in this case, connecting a borrower to a lender through a financial obligation. \n\nThere are a few different types of bonds: \n\n - Corporate Bonds: Old Books INC. could issue $1 million (in bonds) with a 6% annual interest rate and 10-year maturity. Your rich uncle buys (lends) you $100,000, receiving $6,000 in interest payments annually, with his principal (the $100,000) returned as a lump sum after 10 years. Unlike equity investors, bondholders don't own part of the business – they're lenders with a fixed claim to interest and principal. \n - Convertible Bonds: Maybe nobody wants to lend you at a low interest rate as they think it's too risky. To make your bonds more attractive, you might make them convertible – giving bondholders the option to convert their bonds into a predetermined number of shares (stock) instead of receiving their principal back. If Old Books INC. thrives and its stock soars, bondholders could choose to become owners instead of remaining lenders converting their loan into ownership. \n - Zero-Coupon Bonds: Perhaps you don't want to pay interest yearly because you think you will have more cash later. You might issue zero-coupon bonds that pay no annual interest. Instead, investors buy them at a discount, giving you $600,000 for bonds with a $1 million face value (money returned to the investor once the loan expires), with the difference representing their interest earned. \n\nNotes: While bonds are primarily traded over-the-counter (OTC), some are listed on stock exchanges. Businesses also often hold government bonds issued by governments (e.g., U.S. treasuries, gilts) or municipal bonds, which are issued by local governments and are usually tax-exempt. This is how Warren Buffett holds cash—instead of letting money sit there, you lend it to the government for a short period to earn interest. It's like a very fancy savings account!\n\n 3. Derivatives \n\nYou've secured your capital and are busy building your business! Inside your bookstore, you add a cozy lounge area, serving warm drinks and baked goods to delight your customers. But as time rolls on and your business expands, you notice something tricky: the prices of goods you rely on—books, paper, flour, coffee—keep bouncing up and down throughout the year. It's a headache trying to charge customers consistent prices when your costs won't stay put. You start wondering if there's a way to lock in the prices you pay to wholesalers for books and paper, or even the flour and coffee you need. Heck, you'd even pay extra for that certainty, just to know your costs ahead of time—all you want is stability. Then your friend pipes up with an idea: derivatives. You hesitate, remembering Warren Buffett's stern warning: \"I view derivatives as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system.\" Still, your friend's enthusiasm nudges you to take a closer look. The word \"derivative\" means something drawn from another source—these financial tools get their value from underlying assets. Here are some derivatives you might consider for your business: \n\n- Options: Imagine buying insurance that gives you the option, but doesn't force you, to buy or sell something at “x” price at a later date. That's an option! Say you're worried about a new book by the highly anticipated author's novel flopping, but you don't want to miss out on potential profits if it's the next Harry Potter. You pay the distributor a small fee for the right to buy copies at $10 each in the future without buying any right now. If the book takes off and the price soars, you cash it, securing them at $10 and selling at a profit. If it's a dud, you walk away with no obligation to buy them. Contracts like these give you the right (but not the obligation) to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset at a set price before or at expiration. \n\n- Futures: Similar to options, futures are agreements to buy or sell something at a price locked in today, but here's the catch—you're committed. For example, you want to keep selling coffee at $5 a cup in your lounge, no matter what. So, you buy a futures contract to get coffee beans at $2 per pound in six months. If bean prices drop to $1, you'll pay $2 and miss out on extra profit. But if they shoot up to $4, you're still paying $2, keeping your $5 coffee price steady. It's a trade-off for certainty. \n\n -Forwards: Consider these as futures' private cousins—customized deals not traded on public exchanges. You sit down directly with another business, say a local coffee roaster, and agree to buy beans at $2 per pound next year. It's tailored to your needs, but there's no exchange to back it up—just trust between you and them. Similar to futures, but quieter and more personal. \n\n- Swaps: These are like swapping unpredictability for calm between contracts. Suppose your supplier gives you a rolling credit that is prime (government risk- free rate) + 2%. Another shop in town has a fixed loan at a rate of 5%. You decide you would rather know your expenses than have interest rate risk, so you pay a fee to swap contracts. The other store takes the risk of interest rate jumps, and you get peace of mind (though this is a bit fancy for a small shop and usually happens off-exchange). \n\n- Contracts for Difference (CFDs): These are more like a bet on price moves without owning anything. Say you think flour prices will rise next month. You agree with a broker to pocket the difference between today's $10 per bag and whatever it hits later—maybe $12—without buying the flour. If you're right, you profit; if not, you pay. It's a gamble, not a staple for running your lounge, but it's out there. \n\nNotes: Derivatives can tie to commodities (like your coffee and flour), equities (like books), bonds, currencies, or indices. Some, like futures and options, trade on exchanges; others, like forwards and swaps, happen over-the-counter (OTC). They could steady your costs—or, as Buffett warns, explode if mishandled. 1\n\n 4. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Mutual Funds & Indexes \n\nYou've mastered the financial tricks—loans, bonds, derivatives—and poured that know- how into your bookstore and lounge. Hard work pays off: your business blossoms into a regional champion with multiple locations and one step closer to staring down Amazon. As growth kicks in, you take a big leap and launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO), meaning your shares now trade on an exchange. Congrats! Something neat happens next —those shares start changing hands like hotcakes. People notice, buzz builds, and your business's valuation climbs right along with it. Suddenly, you're on the radar of mutual fund managers, your stock gets roped into indices, and it even lands in ETFs. But what are these things, and why do they matter to you? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, Mutual Funds. These are pools of money from many investors. These pools are later managed by professional money managers and their teams (the teams get paid for their services from the pool). Some of these managers might scoop up your shares. There are two flavours: Open-End Funds, where investors buy or sell shares directly from the fund company—not on exchanges (like ordering straight from the factory) and buy sell on the valuation of what is in the basket. Then there are Closed-End Funds, which trade on exchanges like regular stocks, sometimes at a bargain or a premium to their real value (value of the baskets). If a mutual fund manager likes your bookstore's story—steady coffee sales, loyal book buyers—they might grab your stock for their fund, giving you a cash boost and bragging rights. \n\nNext, Indices. Think of these as scoreboards tracking a bunch of stocks—like the Dow Jones or S&P 500. They don't trade on their own, but they're the backbone for other tools. As your business grows, it might get added to an index, say one for retail or small-cap champs. That's a badge of honour—it means you're a player. Plus, it ties into derivatives (like those index options or futures we talked about) and ETFs (more on this in a second), pulling more eyes your way. \n\nAnd then there's Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Picture a basket of goodies—stocks, bonds, whatever—where you buy one share and get a tiny slice of everything inside instead of buying each piece separately. Your stock might end up in one as you grow. Here's what's out there: Equity ETFs track stock indices, like the S&P 500—maybe your shares join the party. Bond ETFs follow fixed-income stuff, less your speed. Commodity ETFs chase gold or oil prices, though coffee-bean ETFs aren't big yet. Sector ETFs zoom in on industries—imagine a \"bookstore and café\" sector with you in it. And Inverse/Leveraged ETFs? They're wild—betting against or juicing up an index's moves, not your usual cup of coffee. \n\nNotes: ETFs mix stock-like trading (on exchanges) with mutual fund vibes (pooled investments). Mutual funds can be exchange-traded, too, if they're closed-end. Indices? They're the silent engines behind ETFs, futures, and market chatter. Together, they signal your business isn't just a shop anymore—it's a contender. \n\n 5. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) \n\nYou have come a long way. Your bookstore and lounge empire is now a powerhouse, growing steadily and flush with cash. You are itching to grow to rival the big chains around the country. But there are only so many shops you can open before you hit a wall— so you sit down to scout new opportunities. You start studying other successful chains, and one giant catches your eye: Howard Schultz's Starbucks. Digging into their business, you stumble across the \"Starbucks Effect\"—neighbourhood property prices jump when a Starbucks pops up. Curious, you check your own locations. What do you know? Your shops are sparking the same magic. Dollar signs flash in your mind. You could snap up the real estate around your stores and ride that wave—but you don't want to tie up all the precious cash you've earned. So, you hatch a plan: pool some of your money with your investors' and launch a REIT—a Real Estate Investment Trust. Think of a REIT as a stock-like investment that owns a stake in properties or property-related assets. Here's what they look like: \n\n - Equity REITs: These own and run income-producing real estate—think strip malls or buildings near your shops, renting out space for steady cash flow. \n - Mortgage REITs: These focus on lending, investing in mortgages or mortgage- backed securities, earning from interest rather than rent. \n - Hybrid REITs: A mix of both—owning properties and holding mortgages, blending the best of each world. \n\nNotes: REITs trade on exchanges like stocks, letting you dip ig into real estate without locking up all your funds. It's a way to grow your empire beyond books and coffee. \n\nAs your bookstore and lounge empire grows, you might stumble across a few other financial tools—fancy stuff I won’t linger on too long. There’s Commodities, like trading gold, oil, or even coffee beans outright (usually through those futures we talked about) or tracking baskets of them via indices. Then there’s Forex, swapping currencies fast with spot trades, or betting on exchange rates with currency futures and options—handy if your coffee supplier’s overseas. And don’t forget Structured Products: things like asset- backed securities (bonds tied to loans), collateralized debt obligations (fancy loan bundles), or equity-linked notes (debt hitched to stock performance). They’re out there, mostly off-exchange, and might cross your path as you scale up—just don’t trip over them! \n\nBonus - Depository Receipts \n\nHopefully, I haven't lost all of you yet, and you don't feel like all this information is too overbearing. Moreover, I hope you don't fall under the false impression that all these different systems and platforms (that help make today's markets run) are just used to gatekeep it from you and complicate your life. Some of the instruments you can purchase are there to make buying what you are interested in more accessible (of course, a fee is assigned for this convenience). \n\nFor this product, I want you to follow along with a simple thought experiment. For a moment, imagine you are living in a small town in the middle of Canada; you know only English, and your primary source of income is in Canadian dollars. You have become fascinated with buying stock in a South Korean and a Brazilian company. Generally, according to the respective countries' securities laws, you would need to be a resident or have a resident buy stock on your behalf. \n\nYou, living in the middle of Canada, thousands of kilometres away from both Brazil and South Korea, don't know anyone there, can't speak Korean or Portuguese, and have no idea how even to transfer money and convert it to the respective local currencies (Korean won or Brazilian real). How could you possibly buy stock from those countries? Well, like in many things, you can give up and move on... however, you are determined and insist on doing it. Your other option is to hope that the company decides to also list in Canada (being sold in Toronto's stock exchange (TSE) in this case). However, lady luck doesn't shine on you, and that doesn't happen. So you save up, load up Google Translate, pack up your bags, get on a plane, fly, find a broker, try to convert your currency, register with the country, wait, in some cases months, to get approval and then work on reporting income and paying tax on profit in both Canada and South Korea or Brazil... but that's wildly impractical. Is there a better way? Could someone make it easier and help you out? \n\nLet's look back in history to find inspirations for possible solutions. Hundreds of years ago, as commerce was exploding across the continents, merchants could not carry gold or valuables to trade as they were too heavy or impractical. What ended up happening? They would find custodians (such as banks, merchants, governments, etc.) and get a receipt for the gold/valuables. Money was becoming a transaction medium of promise notes (meaning you would get paid a paper certificate or a claim on a trustee's gold reserves); the same idea can be used here for a depository receipt. \n\nThink of depository receipts as incorporating what we discussed about ETFs—a one-stock basket with a hedging tool (a tool used to convert your currency—Canadian dollars—to the local currency of where the stock is from) built in. Let's examine the main types: \n\nADRs --- (American Depository Receipts) \n\nADRs are the most common type of depository receipt, created in 1927 when the American market was looking for ways to invest in foreign companies without the complications of international trading. \n\nHow they work:\n \n 1. A U.S. bank (like JPMorgan Chase or Bank of New York Mellon) purchases shares of a foreign company \n 2. These shares are held in custody at a local branch or correspondent bank in the company's home country \n 3. The U.S. bank issues certificates representing these shares to be traded on American exchanges \n 4. The ADRs are priced in dollars and pay dividends in dollars \n\nReal-life scenario: Say you want to invest in Toyota. Instead of navigating the Tokyo Stock Exchange, you can simply buy Toyota's ADR (ticker: TM) on the New York Stock Exchange. When Toyota pays dividends in yen, the depositary bank converts them to dollars before sending them to ADR holders. One Toyota ADR might represent two actual Toyota shares, depending on how the bank structured the certificate. \n\nADRs come in three levels, each with different requirements: \n - Level I: Traded over-the-counter with minimal SEC reporting requirements \n - Level II: Listed on major exchanges with more disclosure \n - Level III: Allows the company to raise capital in the U.S. market with full SEC registration \n\nCDRs --- (Canadian Depository Receipts) \n\nCDRs are newer than ADRs, launched in 2021 by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). They follow a similar concept but with a key difference in how they handle currency fluctuations. \n\nHow they work: \n \n 1. CIBC purchases shares of a foreign (often U.S.) company \n 2. These shares are held in custody \n 3. CIBC issues certificates representing these shares to be traded on Canadian exchanges \n 4. The CDRs are priced in Canadian dollars and pay dividends in Canadian dollars \n 5. But here is teh kicker Unlike ADRs, CDRs have a floating conversion ratio that changes daily based on exchange rates \n\nReal-life scenario: A Canadian investor interested in Apple doesn't want to deal with currency exchange rates or U.S. estate tax issues. Instead of buying Apple shares directly on the NASDAQ, they can purchase Apple CDRs (ticker: AAPL.NE) on the Neo Exchange in Toronto. \n\nThe floating ratio is what makes CDRs unique. If Apple trades at $175 USD and the exchange rate is 1.35 CAD to 1 USD, CIBC might set the ratio so that one CDR represents 1/10 of an Apple share and trades at around $23.63 CAD ($175 × 1.35 ÷ 10). If the Canadian dollar strengthens against the U.S. dollar the next day, the ratio would automatically adjust to maintain the CDR's price in Canadian dollars. This means CDR holders are protected from currency fluctuations - a significant advantage over ADRs, where the conversion rate is fixed when the ADR is created. \n\nEDRs --- (European Depository Receipts) \n\nEDRs work similarly to ADRs but are for non-European companies looking to access European capital markets. \n\nHow they work: \n - A European bank purchases shares of a non-European company \n - These shares are held in custody \n - The bank issues certificates representing these shares to be traded on European exchanges \n - The EDRs are typically priced in euros \n\nEDRs are less standardized than their American counterparts. While ADRs have been refined over nearly a century with clear SEC guidelines, EDRs operate under various European regulatory frameworks. Some key points about EDRs: \n - They can be traded on multiple European exchanges simultaneously \n - They typically follow a fixed ratio model similar to ADRs rather than the floating ratio of CDRs \n - They're sometimes called Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) when they're designed to be traded on multiple international markets, not just European ones \n - They often have lighter regulatory requirements than ADRs, making them attractive to companies from emerging markets like Russia and India \n\nReal-life scenario: A Russian energy company like Gazprom might issue EDRs traded on the London Stock Exchange. This gives European investors a way to invest in Gazprom through a familiar exchange, with transactions and dividends in euros or pounds rather than rubles. It also allows Gazprom to access European capital without having to meet the full listing requirements of European exchanges. So going back to our Canadian investor wanting to buy South Korean and Brazilian stocks depository receipts provide the solution. Instead of dealing with all those barriers, you can simply buy the ADRs, CDRs, or EDRs (depending on what's available) through your local broker, using your Canadian dollars, filing only Canadian taxes, and sleeping well at night knowing you've diversified globally without all the headaches. \n\n",

        "title": "Timing the market - the psychology of when to buy",
        "selftext": "A common saying amongst investors is 'you can't time the market'. This is often said in relation to timing the market as a whole or an ETF that tracks an index such as the S&P 500. \n\nBut what about individual stocks - can you time those?\n\nPutting aside the idea that a company goes belly up and we lose all our money - let's assume this is a quality company that will likely increase its earnings. **What would be the best way to buy this stock and how could you know at which points to buy?** \n\nWell, firstly you would need to do some level of absolute and relative valuation to determine what you think it's worth - this would likely include some type of discounted cash flow model and a comparison of its peer's financials. \n\nOnce we've done that - we can start looking at multiples. \n\nIndividual stocks normally trade within a multiple range over long periods of time. **What does that mean?** \n\nThe big one you've probably heard of is the price/earnings (or p/e) ratio. The other big one is price/free cash flow. Simply put, it is the number of times you would need to multiply earnings to equal market cap. \n\nIf we look at a chart for [Apple](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio), we can see that Apple's p/e ratio range hovered between 10-35 for the past 14 years. \n\n**What would have been the best way to buy this stock and how could you have known at which points to buy?**\n\nA common trap investors fall into is that they simply want their stock to go up. But if we're buying this stock for 14 years, we don't want a sudden rise. What we actually want is to buy the stock at various points  in line with our income (most of us don't have a $1 million lump sum to chuck into Apple at 10 p/e). **But at what points?** \n\nThis is a a group of words that gets touted a lot and one we all hate by now but - Dollar Cost Average (DCA). Hopefully we all know what this means (if not, please Google). \n\nIf you were to DCA into Apple over those 14 years between the p/e range of 10-35, your average p/e would fall somewhere around 20. (*Like I said, this requires valuation* \\- you cannot guess what p/e range you think a stock will trade based on historical values). \n\nQuite often we're waiting for a stock to be at a bargain of 10 p/e, but during that time we miss the boat and the stock continues to go up - and in hindsight it would have been better to continue buying within our p/e range, even if that meant buying at a 20-30 p/e. \n\nAdditionally, if you look at [charts of Apple's earnings, p/e ratio and stock price ](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)\\- both earnings and stock price have increased markedly since 2010, while p/e ratio has only budged up slightly in comparison. Thus, while multiples can create bargains and volatility in the short term, earnings are the real driver of price over the long term.  \n\nCharlie Munger had a great quote on this, which I will leave you with: \n\n*‘Over the long term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you’re not going to make much different than a 6% return – even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you’ll end up with a fine result.’*",

        "title": "Thoughts on the impact of the Magnificent 7 on the returns of the S&P 500",
        "selftext": "The S&P 500 has offered exceptional returns since the beginning of 2023. It rallied 26% in 2023, 23% in 2024, and it is already up 2.5% this year. While this performance is impressive, the effect of the Magnificent 7 on the returns of the S&P 500 has dramatically increased in recent years. As a result, it is important for investors to know the quantitative effect of the Magnificent 7 on the benchmark index and have a sense of what to expect this year.\n\nFirst of all, the weight of the Magnificent 7, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), on the S&P 500 has surged from 22% in 2020 to 33% now. This is the highest percent of the seven largest companies in history. In other words, never in history have the seven largest companies comprised one-third of the S&P 500.\n\nNotably, the outsized returns of the S&P 500 in each of the last two years resulted almost fully from the Magnificent 7. Without these stocks, the S&P 500 would have returned just 4.1% in 2023 and 6.3% in 2024. It is thus important to realize the impact of each of these juggernauts on the total return of the stock market.\n\nSome investors claim that the broad stock market has performed poorly, as its return would have been modest without the contribution from the seven largest stocks. However, it is misleading to exclude the best stocks and draw conclusions about the broad market. This bias is essentially the same as the well-known “cherry picking” bias, which can lead to highly misleading conclusions.\n\nOn the other hand, it is important to realize that just seven companies affect the total return of the stock market to a great extent. As these companies essentially belong to the same sector (even Tesla is essentially a tech stock given its innovation; it is not a conventional consumer discretionary stock), the S&P 500 is much less diversified than most investors think. If the tech sector faces a downturn, such as deceleration in the artificial intelligence boom or competition from foreign competitors, it is likely to severely hurt the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nOn the one hand, the Magnificent 7 are not likely to match this year the returns they offered in recent years due to their rich valuation levels. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla are currently trading at forward P/E ratios of 29.2, 31.1, 31.0, 36.4, 20.8, 28.3 and 124, respectively. On the other hand, as long as these exemplary companies maintain their exciting growth prospects, their stocks are likely to maintain their premium valuation. These seven stocks are expected by analysts to grow their earnings per share by 50%, 12%, 9%, 14%, 12%, 6% and 20%, respectively, this year.\n\nAs a group, the Magnificent 7 are currently trading at a weighted average forward P/E ratio of 36.2 and they are expected to grow their earnings per share by a weighted average of 19% this year. Given their impressive record of beating the analysts’ estimates, the Magnificent 7 are highly likely to meet or exceed the analysts’ estimates this year. If they do and they maintain their exciting growth potential, their stocks are likely to maintain their premium valuation. If their average P/E ratio remains approximately flat, the Magnificent 7 are likely to rally 19% this year (their return will be roughly equal to their EPS growth rate).\n\nOf course, it is impossible to predict the future valuation of these stocks but the above provides an indication of what return to expect this year if the companies meet the analysts’ consensus and their growth potential remains strong. If the Magnificent 7 rally 19% this year, they will contribute a 6.3% return to the S&P 500 (=19% times 33%).\n\nThis is a great boost to the S&P 500 by just seven stocks but it is nowhere close to the boost received in each of the last two years (22% in 2023 and 17% in 2024). If the P/E ratios of the Magnificent 7 expand, their contribution to the S&P 500 will be even higher, but it is prudent not to rely on such an outcome, given the already high P/E ratios of these stocks.\n\nTo conclude, the S&P 500 is less diversified than ever due to the huge weight of the seven greatest technological stocks in the index. As a result, most of the excessive returns of the index since the beginning of 2023 have resulted from the Magnificent 7. On the one hand, investors should be aware of the high sensitivity of the S&P 500 to the performance of just a few stocks, particularly given the rich valuation of these stocks. On the other hand, given the absence of any signs of fatigue on the business prospects of the Magnificent 7, the outlook remains positive for the S&P 500.\n\nIf you found this article interesting, you are likely to find this investing book interesting as well:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Investing-Stocks-Bonds-Retirement-Project/dp/B0D47BPY9J/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?crid=1PQOVON5V3P4V&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TqRtNB85UCHComFFpkLeAqEoSvDZHSbFEgRm74g10c3GjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.RnSJ8Q5UP-ooXdONWUiL7D3UH\\_06GolyxNQjD3xSxI8&dib\\_tag=se&keywords=aristofanis+papadatos&qid=1739194231&s=books&sprefix=aristofanis+papadatos%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C468&sr=1-1](https://www.amazon.com/Investing-Stocks-Bonds-Retirement-Project/dp/B0D47BPY9J/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1PQOVON5V3P4V&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TqRtNB85UCHComFFpkLeAqEoSvDZHSbFEgRm74g10c3GjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.RnSJ8Q5UP-ooXdONWUiL7D3UH_06GolyxNQjD3xSxI8&dib_tag=se&keywords=aristofanis+papadatos&qid=1739194231&s=books&sprefix=aristofanis+papadatos%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C468&sr=1-1)",

I'm wondering when would be a good time to close out my position? Should I wait for further gains, or is now a good time to cash in, given the market's current volatility?\n\nAlso, I have around $10,000 ready to deploy into new investments. I'm looking for some solid stock suggestions that have good potential for growth. Here’s what I’m considering:\n\n1. **Tech Giants:** With AI and tech continuing to drive the market, I'm thinking about adding to positions in companies like Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT). They've had strong earnings reports and seem to be well-positioned for the future.\n\n2. **Healthcare:** Stocks like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) or Pfizer (PFE) might offer some stability, especially with the ongoing advancements in the healthcare sector. What do you guys think about the long-term prospects of these stocks?\n\n3. **Energy:** With the current global situation, energy stocks might be a good play. Companies like ExxonMobil (XOM) or Chevron (CVX) could benefit if oil prices rise. Any thoughts on the sustainability of these companies' dividends?\n\n4. **Dividend Aristocrats:** Considering Coca-Cola is a dividend aristocrat, I'm also looking at other dividend-paying stocks for consistent income. Procter & Gamble (PG) or PepsiCo (PEP) could be interesting additions.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on whether I should hold or sell my KO stock and any other stock suggestions you have for my $10k investment. Looking forward to the discussion!\n\nThanks!",

        "title": "Investing in Stocks with Strong Free Cash Flow: A Key Strategy for Success",
        "selftext": "Free cash flow is a vital financial metric that provides insights into a company’s financial health and operational efficiency. It is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. Companies with positive free cash flow have the flexibility to reinvest in their business, return capital to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks, pursue growth opportunities, and navigate challenging economic conditions.\n\nWhy Focus on Stocks with Strong Free Cash Flow?\n\nInvestors are drawn to companies with strong free cash flow for several reasons:\n\nFinancial Stability: Companies with consistent positive free cash flow are better positioned to weather economic downturns and unforeseen challenges. They have the resources to meet debt obligations, invest in research and development, and innovate to stay competitive in the market.\n\nCapital Allocation: Companies with excess free cash flow can strategically allocate capital to value-creating initiatives such as acquisitions, expansions, or returning cash to shareholders. This disciplined approach to capital allocation enhances shareholder value over the long term.\n\nGrowth Potential: Strong free cash flow allows companies to invest in growth opportunities, drive product development, and expand market share. As a result, investors may benefit from capital appreciation as the company’s value increases.\n\nReturn on Investment: Investing in companies with solid free cash flow yields can potentially lead to attractive returns for investors. Companies that consistently generate excess cash may reward shareholders through dividends, stock buybacks, or reinvestment in the business for sustainable growth.\nIdentifying Stocks with Strong Free Cash Flow\n\nWhen evaluating potential investment opportunities, investors can analyze a company’s free cash flow and key metrics to gauge its financial health and future prospects. Some aspects to consider include:\n\nFree Cash Flow Yield: Calculated by dividing free cash flow by market capitalization, the free cash flow yield provides insights into how efficiently a company generates cash relative to its valuation. A higher free cash flow yield indicates a stronger company.\n\nOperating Performance: Analyzing a company’s free cash flow growth trend, cash flow from operations, and cash conversion cycle can provide a comprehensive overview of its operational performance and financial strength.\n\nDividend Payout Ratio: Assessing the percentage of free cash flow allocated towards dividends helps determine whether a company’s dividend payments are sustainable and if there is room for future dividend increases.\n\nSeveral companies demonstrate a consistent track record of generating strong free cash flow and prudent capital management:\n\nApple (AAPL): A technology giant known for its strong free cash flow generation, Apple has a history of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nMicrosoft (MSFT): With a focus on innovation and diversification, Microsoft has consistently produced robust free cash flow, allowing it to invest in growth initiatives and reward shareholders.\n\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ): A healthcare stalwart, Johnson & Johnson’s stable cash flows and prudent financial management have positioned it as a reliable dividend payer and a defensive investment choice.\n\nIn conclusion, investing in stocks with strong free cash flow is a fundamental strategy for long-term success in the stock market. By focusing on companies with robust cash generation, prudent capital allocation, and sustainable growth prospects, investors can enhance their portfolios’ resilience and potential for attractive returns. Conducting thorough research, monitoring key financial metrics, and staying informed about market trends are essential practices for identifying and capitalizing on investment opportunities in companies with strong free cash flow.",

        "title": "Is this the Beginning of the End for Apple Stock?",
        "selftext": "I spent the last few weeks diving deep into Apple and walked away with more questions than answers. Everyone knows Apple is one of the highest-quality companies in the world. The brand strength is second to none, the cash flows are pristine, and the capital return program is immaculate. But the valuation just doesn’t make sense to me anymore. At over $3 trillion and a P/E of 31, I’m struggling to justify why I’d want to be long at these levels.\n\nI broke the company down across six core dimensions: valuation, product innovation, services, competitive positioning, capital allocation, and strategic vision. What stood out most was the lack of future investment and positioning. Apple is still refining its ecosystem, but it no longer feels like it’s expanding it. It’s been nearly a decade since a true breakout product. Vision Pro is impressive on a hardware level, but it hasn’t found real traction and is completely too expensive for mass market adoption. The iPhone remains dominant, but dependency on a single product this far in feels fragile.\n\nServices are a bright spot in terms of margin contribution, but even there, I see structural risks. The Google Search deal alone makes up a huge share of services revenue and could be threatened by regulatory changes. Meanwhile, platform control over things like the App Store is under pressure in Europe and increasingly in the U.S. There’s also a saturation problem. Apple has over 2 billion active devices. Future growth comes mostly from squeezing more out of existing users, not expanding the base. Something I personally have grown tired of as an Iphone user.\n\nFrom a competitive standpoint, Apple feels like it's falling behind. Microsoft owns the AI stack from chip to cloud to productivity. Google is pushing vertically with Gemini and TPUs (not to mention Waymo, Quantum, etc). Meta is all-in on open source and model training. Apple, in contrast, is integrating other people's models while staying out of infrastructure entirely. That may be fine in the short term, but over time, it limits value capture. If you don’t own the tech, you’re stuck renting it at best.\n\nOn capital allocation, Apple has been masterful. The buyback has driven EPS growth far beyond what revenue growth would suggest. But buybacks only create durable value when the stock is undervalued. At 31x earnings, that’s a tough argument to make. Dividends are modest and consistent, but nothing to base a long-term position on.\n\nWhat really sealed my concern was modeling out different return scenarios. I included dividend yield in every case. In the bull case, assuming 8% EPS CAGR and a 30x multiple, I end up with around a 7.5% total return per year. Not bad, but hardly compelling when compared to alternatives. In the base case, where EPS grows 5% and the P/E compresses to 25, returns fall to around 1.6% annually. And in the re-rating case, EPS growth at 2% and a 15x multiple, total return becomes deeply negative. A 50% drawdown is not unthinkable if the narrative ever shifts from “tech growth compounder” to “incredible consumer staple with high market share.”\n\nTo be clear, I’m not calling for Apple to collapse. The business and brand are rock solid. But the stock is priced for a future I’m not sure is coming. It reminds me of Coca-Cola in the late 1990s. A world-class brand, dominant in its category, but trading at growth multiples long after the real growth had slowed. Those who held from 1998 waited over a decade just to break even in real terms.\n\nI don’t think Apple is a short. But I can’t make a strong case for going long from here either. The risk-reward is skewed. Upside is limited even if things go well. Downside becomes real if the market ever reprices the stock based on forward returns instead of past excellence.\n\nI do think that Apple will remain inflated due to its easy inclusion in so many different funds, but this too can't hold up the PE forever. IMO Apple does not deserve an equal or higher PE than MSFT, GOOG, META, and AMZN and it's not particularly close. ",

        "selftext": "I'm a beginner to investing btw, so I'm sorry for any mistakes.\n\nAnd I mean buying the stock of the phone company, not the vegetable. Because that would be a depreciating asset. Because like if I bought an apple, I'll just take a bite because I like apples and now it's that much less valuable. And I wouldn't be able to stop because apples taste pretty nice.\n\nI think it's good time for me to buy because the price is back down to good levels. Also their conference thing is coming up next month. And pretty cool people work there so they will announce some cool features and stuff I assume.\n\nAnd like they are going to launch higher priced phones, but the design is totally different. And as much as people may hate it, they will buy it, because it's a new design. Plus their decision to make all cameras 48 MP will be something every reviewer will talk about.\n\nAlso they are exempt from tariffs anyway and like their apple intelligence has been pretty bad so far, but I'm sure this time they will fix it so it will be pretty cool too. Plus the new air model and stuff will make it so more people buy different models, like apple has always been good at making people buy the more pricey items in their lineup.\n\nSo I personally think a lot of value to come from the company and this looks like a cool price to buy at and maybe sell in 3-4 months.\n\nIt went pretty low to 170ish when tariffs were first invented, then it was also like 250ish max in the previous year. So like 200 sounds pretty cool to buy considering what's coming up.\n\nBut also I saw on reddit someone said treasury something something is 5% and that means there will be less spending power so idk and with apple raising prices for the coming lineup idk. So like maybe I shouldn't, but maybe I should? I think I'm going to, it just feels right?\n\nThanks. This isn't financial advice btw, just my opinions and feels.",

Kind of negligible imo. But now let’s say, again extremely roughly, apples net income falls 16b due to the tariffs, so 16% down to their valuation because their net income is 100b. I know this is tough. Poke holes in it if you want.\n\nStock is down like 13% in last week. So is market valuing Apple about the same? Disagree? Am I wrong?

        "selftext": "Apple is the world’s most valuable company, the most beloved consumer brand, and the best-run capital return machine in the modern stock market. It has survived every bear thesis, adapted to every challenge, and delivered shareholders a relentless stream of buybacks, dividends, and steady earnings growth.\n\nAt 33x forward earnings, the market is pricing Apple as if it will continue this dominance indefinitely. But no company can defy gravity forever. Apple’s next phase of growth depends on emerging markets, where its traditional advantages—brand strength, pricing power, and ecosystem lock-in—are not guaranteed to work the same way they have in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMuch like a perfectly applied face of makeup, Apple looks flawless at first glance. But take a closer look, and a few cracks start to appear. Buybacks are masking slowing earnings growth. Services margins, long assumed to be unassailable, are under regulatory threat. And in markets where Apple is banking on its next wave of users, it’s facing competition from companies that know these regions better and are playing an entirely different game.\n\nThe market assumes Apple will extend its dominance effortlessly. The data suggests otherwise.\n\n# The Market Assumes the iPhone Will Conquer Everywhere. That’s a Risky Bet.\n\nIn North America, Apple’s pricing power is sacred. In emerging markets, it is anything but.\n\nApple’s dominance in the U.S. is built on two things: a premium brand and a seamless ecosystem. People don’t leave iOS because switching out of iMessage, AirDrop, and the App Store is a hassle. But in places like India, Latin America, and Africa, the default phone isn’t an iPhone. It’s an Android device, often made by Xiaomi, OPPO, or Transsion, where users have already built their own ecosystems of digital services.\n\nThat’s a problem for Apple’s long-term growth. If users in these markets don’t start on iOS, they aren’t going to be locked into Apple’s ecosystem later. And in the places where Apple is growing, it’s often doing so by selling older iPhones at discounted prices—an approach that works for market share but erodes the premium pricing model that has sustained its margins.\n\nApple is winning some battles, but at what cost?\n\n* **Latin America**: iPhone shipments jumped 21% year-over-year in 2024, but most of that growth came from discounted older models and local assembly in Brazil to avoid import tariffs. The broader smartphone market in the region grew 10% in the same period. That means Apple isn’t necessarily taking over—it’s just keeping up by cutting prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi continues to outsell Apple, offering comparable hardware at a fraction of the price.\n* **India**: Apple is making its biggest push yet, opening flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi, ramping up local manufacturing, and introducing aggressive financing options. Morgan Stanley estimates India will account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth over the next five years. But the market reality is stark: iOS has less than 11% market share, and the vast majority of smartphones sold in India cost under $300. Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.\n* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.\n* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.\n\nThe big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.\n\n# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.\n\nApple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.\n\nBut Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.\n\n* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.\n* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.\n* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.\n\nThe App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.\n\nInvestors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.\n\n# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.\n\nApple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.\n\n* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.\n* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.\n* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.\n\n# When Does Apple Become a Buy?\n\nApple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:\n\n* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.\n* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.\n* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.\n\nApple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price? I don't think it is.\n\nApple is the world’s most valuable company, the most beloved consumer brand, and the best-run capital return machine in the modern stock market.

Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.\n* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.\n* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.\n\nThe big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.\n\n# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.\n\nApple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.\n\nBut Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.\n\n* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.\n* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.\n* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.\n\nThe App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.\n\nInvestors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.\n\n# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.\n\nApple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.\n\n* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.\n* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.\n* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.\n\n# When Does Apple Become a Buy?\n\nApple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:\n\n* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.\n* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.\n* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.\n\nApple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price? I don't think it is.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI put together the above deep dive on Apple’s valuation, particularly its challenges in emerging markets and risks to services growth. I work on these memos for my own personal investments, I am not an investment professional. I would love feedback from this community. I hold Apple indirectly through VGT.\n\n**TLDR:** It's an amazing business, trading at what I believe to be a terrible price.",

        "selftext": "I've been thinking about a way to intuitively understand value investing and IMO overlaying market cap and earnings is one of the best ways to do so. The market price is always right by definition but that doesn't necessary mean that the mark-to-market market cap makes sense.\n\nCompanies are primarily money making machines and by analyzing how effectively they make money you can anchor your evaluation of the price.\n\nE.g in this image: [https://imgur.com/a/bQD98jc](https://imgur.com/a/bQD98jc) You can see that the market cap is mostly correlated with earnings over the last decade (Buffett bought in around 2016). P/E expanded heavily post COVID liquidity and even today is at 40x.\n\n(The multiplier is set at 18x b/c that is where the support was during the COVID liquidity crisis matched by repeated support around Feb 2023)\n\nPrices can remain elevated as long as the next marginal buyer believes in the price support. **Value investing is just being very conservative with the price support** and basing it on real data like historical earnings and analyst predicted earnings vs say drawing lines on a chart.\n\nThe gap between how elevated the market cap line is over the earnings (using whatever p/e multiplier you believe makes sense) is a measure of how \"optimistic\" the active market participants are. In AAPLs case, the analysts maybe believe in lowered growth % wise due to global market saturation (VR headsets don't have a market large enough)\n\nThis is a free tool I built and you can play around with it at:  [www.theory-a.com/analyze/AAPL](http://www.theory-a.com/analyze/AAPL)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

The company was last valued at about $14 billion in a May funding round.\n* Talent and infrastructure: More than 100 researchers and ex-OpenAI engineers have tuned the firm’s Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines precisely the kind of expertise Apple lacks as it tries to overhaul Siri and Spotlight.\n* A Google off-ramp: Safari’s default-search pact with Alphabet nets Apple an estimated $20 billion a year.

        "title": "Apple Stock: My thoughts on price, revenue segments and devices",
        "selftext": "Apple surprised the market by reporting record-high financial results for Q4 2024 (ending September 28, 2024), with revenue hitting $94.9 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year. This performance defied expectations, fueled by the launch of the iPhone 16 lineup, packed with innovative features and the introduction of Apple Intelligence.\n\nMany investors were caught off guard, as sentiment around Apple had turned cautious. Concerns about the company’s growth potential were mounting, especially amid global political challenges. Governments worldwide have been ramping up efforts to tax foreign products, while China has been tightening restrictions on Apple’s market presence, citing privacy and AI content moderation concerns.\n\nBefore we explore these challenges in detail, let’s first take a closer look at Apple’s net sales by reported segments over the past three years.\n\nLooking at Apple’s net sales in Greater China, it’s clear that the company faces significant challenges. While sales in major quarters like Q1 have dropped noticeably, other quarters, including Q4, have shown more stability with only slight declines over time. This reflects Apple’s strategic decision not to push back against China’s stringent regulations. With China accounting for one-fifth of Apple’s sales and producing a large share of its devices (though some production has shifted to India and the U.S.), resistance would be costly.\n\nHowever, Beijing isn’t making things easy. Every time CEO Tim Cook steps back to comply with regulatory demands, the Chinese government seems to expect even more concessions. The big question remains: How long will Apple choose accommodation, and how long will Chinese consumers continue choosing Apple over domestic rivals like Huawei?\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s relationship with Europe tells a different story. Despite increasingly strict EU regulations, Apple has steadily expanded its market presence there. Interestingly, the company has taken a unique approach by delaying some software features in Europe, attributing the delays to regulatory challenges. This seems like a calculated move to shift consumer pressure onto EU regulators.\n\nApple’s strategy in these two key regions highlights the delicate balance between compliance, competition, and customer loyalty. It’s a game worth watching closely.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at Apple’s sales by product category. As many investors have already realized, it’s hard to imagine Apple launching another groundbreaking product on the scale of the iPhone. It’s not for lack of trying, but consumer adoption of Apple’s (other tech giants have the same problem) newer products hasn’t yet reached the same iconic status.\n\nThat said, Apple’s future looks promising with its lineup of “affordable luxury” products like wearables, the MacBook Air, and the Mac mini. These devices have been well-received and are likely to continue driving revenue growth.\n\nWe can also see Apple gradually shifting its business core from hardware like the iPhone to services. This appears to be Tim Cook’s long-term strategy: making Apple Services the key reason customers stay loyal to the brand. The seamless integration of devices and services—where a new Apple device instantly feels like “your own” through automatic syncing—is a powerful incentive for consumers. It turns the high price tag into a convenience many are willing to pay for.\n\n**Apple’s ecosystem** might just be its **most valuable product of all**.\n\n# Where Does Apple’s Stock Price Stand Today?\n\nThe big question on every investor’s mind: where does Apple’s stock price sit right now? At the time of writing, Apple is trading near its all-time high of $242 per share, which, in my view, seems a bit overvalued. However, many investors are already placing their bets on Apple’s upcoming Q1 2025 revenue.\n\nHistorically, Q1 has been Apple’s strongest quarter, and Wall Street is optimistic that the next one could be the company’s best yet. With a refreshed product lineup and Apple’s new AI features exclusive to its latest devices, it’s not hard to see why expectations are so high.\n\nAs a long-term value investor, I believe the current price is stretched, and I prefer to wait for a better entry point. Apple’s stock has historically provided attractive dips, offering patient investors great buying opportunities. Let’s not forget that its 52-week low was around $160, and in January 2023, shares were even available for as low as $120.",

GenAI makes it too easy for tens of companies — Meta, OpenAI, Microsoft, Apple, Anthropic, Perplexity, etc. etc. — to provide search for a meaningful fraction of query use cases. The trillion dollar question is whether the pie will grow so fast that Google’s profits will stay steady or grow.\n\nMeanwhile, the government is threatening two sources of distribution: the Apple deal and Chrome. \n\nOutside of this, Google feels healthy to downright exciting. YouTube is increasing in relevance as a Netflix + TikTok combo. Google Cloud is on a tear. Waymo could 10x from here. Android gives them distribution for new software products and Android + Pixel gives them a full stack alternative to Apple (I’d say the worst position Apple’s been in in years because of their track record with AI). Deepmind + Gemini could result in new businesses. And the rest of core Google like Maps, Gmail, and Docs offers a bunch of surface area to monetize.\n\nSo the real question is: what’s the right multiple for Search?",

We've had over a decade of the fed injecting unprecedented amount of liquidity into the financial system - its not a coincidence that we've seen the biggest bull run in our lifetimes beginning after the 2008 financial crisis, because that's precisely when this started happening with QE. Then this got turbocharged again during the 2020 pandemic. Look at this graph of M2 money supply: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) \\- **investable money has nearly 3x since the start of QE**. All that money has to go somewhere, which is why we see the current \"everything\" bubble with stocks and RE all at all time highs. \n\n2. Wealth inequality in our economy has accelerated over the past few decades with the middle class being increasingly hollowed out and companies placing shareholders interests first and employees interests last. The [top 10% of earners own 93% of the stock market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wealthiest-10-americans-own-93-033623827.html), these folks don't need the money they invest to fund their day to day lives and are just looking for the best return on their money. \n\nThis is basic supply and demand problem --> there's been a huge increase in demand for investments with the increased money supply (M2 graph shown above) but the supply of investment opportunities have not kept pace and could argue even decreased: \n\n\\- limited increase in housing supply even as total populations grow and economic opportunities get increasingly  concentrated in a small number of metro areas\n\n\\- a digital economy that makes it easier than ever for huge companies to dominate and further entrench their dominance by unlocking economies of scale, leading to fewer total winners - why invest in 5 different specialty retailers when amazon sells everything for cheaper and delivers to you faster?\n\n  \nThe market may very well be overvalued - who knows - but coming to that judgement purely by looking at historical norms is comparing apples to oranges. The fact is that a smaller number of people hold the vast majority of the investable wealth in the US and all that money is looking to make a return somewhere - so with real estate also at all time highs and in many ways even more overvalued than the stock market when comparing the cost to buy vs rent, combined with interest rates coming down, *where else is all that money going to go?*\n\n  \n",

        "title": "Nike: Just Buy It? [Long-Form Write-Up on $NKE)",
        "selftext": "There are very few companies where the brand name and logo immediately come to mind when you think of an industry or product.\n\nPhones? Apple.\n\nSearch? Google.\n\nShoes? Nike.\n\nNike is one of those rare businesses that doesn't just sell products — it shapes culture, identity, and aspiration. But despite that iconic status, the company is facing one of the most challenging stretches in its modern history.\n\nSales are slowing, margins are under pressure, and tariffs threaten the entire supply chain. Add to that a shaky DTC strategy, strained wholesale relationships, and a stretch of underwhelming innovation, and you’ve got a company in the middle of a full-blown reset.\n\n**From the Track to the Racks**\n\nNike’s story starts on a track in Oregon. In the 1960s, University track coach Bill Bowerman teamed up with his former student Phil Knight to sell high-quality Japanese running shoes in the U.S. under the name Blue Ribbon Sports.\n\nTheir inspiration? Japanese cameras. At the time, brands like Canon and Nikon were taking market share from dominant German makers. Bowerman and Knight believed the same disruption could happen in footwear, where Adidas and Puma ruled the track.\n\nSo they partnered with Japanese shoe manufacturer Onitsuka Tiger, and the business took off. Sales grew, momentum built — until they found out Onitsuka was quietly shopping for new U.S. distributors behind their back.\n\nFeeling betrayed, Bowerman and Knight made a bold decision: go solo. No more reselling — they’d make their own shoes.\n\nAnd just like that, Nike was born. One of the most iconic brands in the world was created in a matter of days. The name “Nike” came from the Greek goddess of victory. The Swoosh? Designed by a college student for $35.\n\nBut don’t worry — a few years later, Knight gave her 500 shares of Nike. If she held on, that little logo turned her into a millionaire.\n\nNike’s early strategy was simple but effective: selling shoes straight out of car trunks at track meets, building personal relationships with runners, and even creating one of the first informal customer databases — tracking shoe sizes, race schedules, and athlete preferences to stay connected. It worked. The first 50,000 pairs were sold almost entirely through word of mouth.\n\nOne of the most iconic early models was the Moon Shoe — designed by Bowerman and inspired by his attempt to improve traction using a waffle iron from his kitchen.\n\nPerhaps the first signal of just how far Bowerman and Knight were willing to go to build the best running shoes in the world — and the Moon Shoe became their first true breakthrough.\n\nFrom there, Nike’s innovation streak took off: the Waffle Trainer, Air cushioning in the Tailwind, and later the futuristic Nike Shox, made famous by Vince Carter’s Olympic dunk over a 7'2\" Frenchman in 2000.\n\n\n\n**The Best Deal in Sports History**\n\nWhile Nike’s early models laid the foundation for its reputation in performance and innovation, what truly catapulted the company into global dominance was arguably the greatest marketing move in sports history.\n\nIn October 1984, Nike signed a young, promising rookie named Michael Jordan. It wasn’t an easy deal — Jordan had his heart set on Adidas, but they weren’t focused on basketball then. Nike saw the opportunity and took a bold swing.\n\nThey offered him a five-year, $2.5 million contract, which, at the time, was basically their entire marketing budget, and built an entire brand around him. The goal was to sell $1 million worth of Air Jordans in the first year.\n\nInstead, they sold $126 million.\n\nThat single bet didn’t just change Nike’s trajectory — it redefined how athletes, brands, and marketing would work for decades to come.\n\n\n\n**The Landscape is Changing**\n\nFor a long time, there were two dominant players in the global footwear and apparel industry: Nike and Adidas. And yes — both still lead the pack. But the momentum has shifted, and lately, it hasn’t been in Nike’s favor.\n\nIn the U.S. market, Adidas has grown its share from 6% to 11% over the last decade, while Nike’s share has stagnated. At the same time, a new trend has emerged: smaller, performance-focused brands are entering the market and gaining serious traction. Two of the most talked-about in recent years are the Swiss brand On and the French brand Hoka.\n\nBefore we dig into the impact these rising players have had — and Nike’s loss of global market share — it’s worth asking: How did we get here?\n\nLike most major shifts, it’s not monocausal. A handful of factors played a role. But in Nike’s case, there’s a particularly clear catalyst: the company’s DTC pivot under former CEO John Donahoe — a strategy that, in hindsight, didn’t play out the way investors had hoped.\n\nNike originally built its dominance through wholesale. For years, it was the undisputed leader in almost every major shoe retailer. But if you look at the 2024 numbers, Nike’s wholesale-to-DTC ratio is now only slightly tilted in favor of wholesale — a big shift from how the business used to operate.\n\nThat change began in 2017, when Nike made a strategic pivot toward direct-to-consumer. Under then-CEO Mark Parker, Nike’s digital business took off. In 2014, online sales totaled just over $1 billion. Five years later, that number had grown fivefold.\n\nThe direction seemed clear: Nike would leverage its brand power by focusing more on DTC, especially through digital channels.\n\nAnd then came what looked like a perfect fit. Just a few years earlier, John Donahoe had joined Nike’s board. With experience as CEO of eBay and ServiceNow, and as Chairman of the Board at PayPal, he brought deep digital expertise. So when Parker stepped down, Donahoe — the tech operator — was tapped to lead Nike into its next phase: a digital-first future.\n\nBefore Donahoe, Nike had only three CEOs. First, the founder, Phil Knight. Then William Perez, Nike’s first external hire, and finally, Mark Parker, who came up through the company and led for over 13 years. Perez, on the other hand, lasted just two. He left after being deemed “not a good cultural fit.”\n\nAt Nike, culture matters. It’s a fuzzy term — one that’s often used as corporate filler. I’m the first to roll my eyes when someone brings up “culture” in a boardroom pitch. But there’s a difference between talking about culture and living it — and Nike has always lived it. You see it in the stories, the athlete relationships, and the leadership style. More on that later when we talk about Elliott Hill, Nike’s new CEO.\n\n*(Just a quick note, I share stock breakdowns like this weekly, with charts and downloadable valuation models, in free emails — subscribe* [*here*](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/newsletters/?utm_source=Reddit) *if that interests you.)*\n\nThe problem Nike had with Perez came back with Donahoe. Despite years on the board, he never quite embodied the Nike way. He led like a consultant, which isn’t all that surprising given his background. Before eBay and ServiceNow, Donahoe spent 20 years at Bain & Company, one of the most prestigious consulting firms in the world, eventually becoming CEO and President.\n\nStill, despite the cultural mismatch, Donahoe’s first year as CEO looked like a success. Nike quickly doubled online revenue, surpassing $10 billion in digital sales. The pandemic certainly helped — stores were closed, and running became a go-to hobby when it was one of the few things people could still do outdoors.\n\nIt was around this time that Donahoe said what’s now become an almost iconic quote: “The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back.”\n\nWell… the consumer did revert back.\n\nPeople were eager to get out again and experience shopping in person. And honestly, I get it. Call me old-school, but I’ve never really understood how people buy shoes online. I need to try them on, walk a few steps. If I ordered without trying them, I’d be sending 90% of them back.\n\nBut let’s get back to Nike’s problem. A major part of the DTC strategy was cutting ties with wholesalers — including Foot Locker, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and many others. The idea was to drive more traffic through Nike’s own channels. But that came at a cost.\n\nJust Foot Locker and Dick’s alone have around five times as many stores as Nike does across the U.S. Cutting those partnerships meant walking away from shelf space — and from millions of eyeballs, free marketing, and the impulse purchases that come with it.\n\nNaturally, a lot of shoppers didn’t head straight to Nike stores — they went to wholesalers. Many of them probably still wanted to buy Nike shoes. And historically, they could. Nike was the No. 1 brand in almost every major retailer. In 2020, 75% of Foot Locker’s inventory comprised Nike and Jordan products.\n\nThat changed quickly.\n\nAfter Nike decided to scale back wholesale partnerships, Foot Locker’s Nike allocation dropped by more than 20%. Other retailers saw even steeper declines. The move hurt both sides — retailers lost a key traffic driver, and the abrupt decision caused many to lose trust in Nike.\n\nAnd when Nike realized it had overestimated its brand pull, it was already in a tough spot. Consumers weren’t walking out of Foot Locker empty-handed and heading to the nearest Nike store — they were just buying something else. The shelves were filled with other brands, and to the retailers’ surprise, those brands sold just fine.\n\nSo when Nike tried to return, it no longer had the same leverage. Retailers didn’t feel the urgency to bring Nike back at the same volume — or on the same terms.\n\nAnd that opened the door for a new wave of brands like On and Hoka. Both were founded by athletes, both offered innovative technology, and both captured consumer excitement, especially among runners and performance-focused shoppers.\n\nWhich leads us to Nike’s second big mistake during its DTC push: It neglected the product.\n\n\n\n**The Decline of Nike Shoes**\n\nI’ve mentioned how Nike used to be an innovation machine. In its early days, product came first — and Nike made sure that mindset stayed at the core of the company. That’s what culture meant at Nike: being product-obsessed, hungry to win, and always pushing new ideas forward.\n\nBut in recent years, Nike has lost that edge. There haven’t been many groundbreaking innovations. Sure, there have been announcements — but not much to back them up.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nAs the company focused on building out its online presence, the product took a back seat. Resources were reallocated, and the goal quietly shifted — from making the best shoes to making more shoes, in order to drive DTC volume and hit digital growth targets.\n\nThat’s why we got wave after wave of Air Max and Air Jordan re-releases in every colorway imaginable — instead of truly new technology. And to be clear: I like those shoes. A lot of people do. But when you flood the market with them, they start to lose their appeal.\n\nFor years, Nike struck the perfect balance — selling at scale while still keeping sneakerheads engaged through scarcity, excitement, and originality. But as the product strategy leaned too far into mass availability, that balance began to slip—and with it, demand.\n\nUnder Donahoe, the balance tipped further toward the volume game, while Nike drifted away from speaking to sneaker culture — the very community that helped build its brand. And look, it would be easy to pin all of this on Donahoe. But that wouldn’t be fair — or true.\n\nNike’s size alone makes it incredibly hard to tailor products to every consumer. Smaller brands like On and Hoka are naturally more agile and can move faster in terms of both design and messaging.\n\nBut here’s the thing: Nike has always had that disadvantage. Long before Donahoe ever became CEO. Something else changed.\n\nWhat changed was how Nike approached its customers.\n\nHistorically, Nike thrived in what’s called a pull market — where you first create a product, and then create demand for it. And Nike mastered this model for two key reasons:\n\nFirst, it was relentlessly product-focused. The innovation was there. The designs were there. Nike shoes didn’t just look good — they performed. In 2019, Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge became the first human to run a marathon distance in under two hours. The controversy? His Nike Vaporfly shoe. Designed so well, it was rumored to have a material impact on the runner’s time. World Athletics even banned the shoe from subsequent races.\n\nSecond, Nike had — and still has — the most powerful athlete portfolio in the world. From Michael Jordan to Serena Williams, LeBron James to Cristiano Ronaldo — no brand has paired product with star power as effectively as Nike.\n\nI know firsthand how powerful Nike’s pull factor used to be. As a kid, I didn’t just want football shoes — I wanted the exact pair my favorite player wore. Nothing else mattered. The same goes for kids who idolize basketball players, tennis stars, golfers, or even celebrities. Nike made it easy to create demand because when you combined that emotional connection with a high-quality product, Nike was unbeatable.\n\nBut in recent years, that model started to break down. As Nike shifted away from its product-first mindset, it also moved away from operating in a pull market. Instead, it started behaving like a typical push brand — trying to predict what consumers wanted and then building products to match.\n\nThat approach doesn’t work for Nike.\n\nThey’re too big, too slow, and frankly, too far removed from niche consumer trends to play that game well. And more importantly, they’ve historically had an edge most brands could only dream of: the ability to shape taste, not follow it.\n\nBut once Nike realized it couldn’t reliably guess what consumers wanted, it made a familiar move — it doubled down on its legacy models. As I mentioned earlier, that’s how we ended up with a flood of Jordans and Air Maxes in every color combination imaginable.\n\n\n\n**Reviving Nike — Win Now!**\n\nLast October, a new chapter began at Nike. Elliott Hill returned to the company — this time as CEO — after working his way up through Nike’s ranks from 1988 to 2020. He started as an intern. When he left, he was the President of Consumer and Marketplace.\n\nHill understands and embodies Nike like few others. For perspective, when he joined in 1988, Nike’s market cap was around $700 million. Today, Nike generates that much in revenue every five days.\n\nSince returning, Hill has wasted no time. He launched what he calls the Win Now strategy — a plan to get Nike back on track by doing what it once did best: focusing on product, rebuilding retail relationships, partnering closely with athletes, and returning to a pull market model.\n\nThe shift is already showing up in bold marketing moves. Nike just ran its first Super Bowl ad since 1998, spending $16 million on the campaign. They signed Caitlin Clark, the biggest name in women’s basketball, to a $28 million deal. And — this one hits especially close to home — they signed a $700 million sponsorship deal with the German national football team, ending a 70-year partnership with Adidas.\n\nBeyond bold marketing moves, Hill is also shifting focus away from the volume game that defined Donahoe’s DTC strategy. His goal is to re-establish Nike Direct as a premium destination — not just a high-traffic sales channel. He’s been clear: Nike became too promotional in recent years.\n\nNow, Nike isn’t a luxury brand, but it has always carried a premium image. And if you read our Moncler newsletter, you’ll remember why excessive discounting can damage that kind of brand equity.\n\nIt didn’t just hurt Nike’s image — it hurt retailers, too. Whenever Nike slashed prices, retailers were forced to follow suit just to stay competitive. That strained relationships and further complicated Nike’s wholesale reset.\n\nBut that chapter’s behind them — at least in intention. Since taking over, Hill has been on the road nonstop, visiting wholesalers, Nike factories, and athletes around the world. His message? “We have to earn our way back to the shelves.”\n\nBut that was October. So now the big question is: How’s the “Win Now” strategy going?\n\n**Recent Results — Win Later?**\n\nWell, there’s not much that suggests Nike is “winning now” — at least if you’re looking strictly at the numbers.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, sales declined 9% overall, with drops across every brand, region, and sales channel. Gross margin took a heavy hit, falling 330 basis points (3.3 percentage points) to 41.5%. And if you looked at the EPS and thought, “Well, that’s not that bad,” keep in mind: it was propped up by a 10% drop in the effective tax rate — a one-off that helped polish otherwise rough results.\n\nSo, why is Elliott Hill’s confidence “reinforced”? Why does he say Nike is on “the right path”? Is he seeing different numbers than the rest of us?\n\nI don’t think so. And believe it or not, I actually don’t dislike the recent trends as much as the headlines suggest.\n\nYes — the results are not good. And they’re even going to get worse. Nike’s guidance for Q4 includes mid-teen revenue declines and a 5% drop in gross margins.\n\nBut here’s the thing: the Win Now strategy was never meant to deliver short-term wins. Hill made that clear from the beginning. He said his plan would hurt the numbers in the short run, but he’s taking the long-term view. I know, calling it “Win Now” is a bit of a lie then. But honestly, would you call your strategy “Win Later?”\n\nOne of Hill’s first major tasks was reducing Nike’s inventory problem. After pandemic-era supply shocks eased, a flood of delayed product hit Nike all at once, leaving them with several seasons’ worth of inventory. Fixing that was going to hurt. But it was necessary.\n\nRetail brands like Nike suffer tremendously when inventory levels get out of control. It clogs up the cash flow statement — you’ve already spent the money to make the product, but you're not getting paid because it’s just sitting there. The longer it sits, the more working capital is tied up and the higher the carrying costs.\n\nBut clearing that inventory also comes at a cost. You have to discount heavily to move product quickly, which not only hurts margins but also dilutes the brand and strains retailer relationships.\n\nHopefully, by now, you can see how everything we’ve discussed — from the DTC pivot to product missteps and retailer tension — fed into this reinforcing cycle that’s been dragging Nike down.\n\nAnd speaking of things hurting Nike…We can’t ignore the most recent development — the one that crushed the stock by 15%, only for it to bounce right back a few days later. You probably know what I’m talking about: Tariff mania.\n\n\n\n**The Impact of Tariffs on Nike**\n\nThe U.S. recently announced a new round of tariffs on imports from Vietnam — a country where Nike now produces over 50% of its footwear and nearly 30% of its apparel.\n\nDepending on how Nike responds — whether by absorbing the cost, passing it on to consumers, or renegotiating with suppliers — the impact could vary widely. But in all scenarios, there’s potential for weakened demand and further pressure on margins.\n\nThere are no precise estimates yet on how Nike’s financials might be affected. Some industry experts suggest shoes that currently retail for $150 could rise to $220–$230, a range that likely assumes the full cost of tariffs is passed on to consumers.\n\nBut in reality, that may not be feasible. Pushing prices that high risks damaging demand, especially in an already soft consumer environment. On the other hand, if Nike absorbs the cost, margins would take a substantial hit. Each option comes with trade-offs, and none of them are easy.\n\nFor now, the situation remains uncertain. Reciprocal tariffs from Vietnam have been paused for 90 days, and initial talks between the U.S. and Vietnam have already taken place. But until there’s more clarity, the uncertainty remains yet another headwind for a business already in reset mode.\n\n\n\n**Valuing the Swoosh**\n\nWe’ve now covered Nike’s strengths — and its many current challenges: declining sales, margin pressure, inventory cleanup, and a strategy reset that will take time. So, when it comes to valuation, I try to reflect all of that — while knowing full well that the more precise a model tries to be, the more likely it is to be wrong.\n\nStill, here’s the thinking behind my assumptions.\n\nBefore the recent tariff announcements, Q4 was already expected to be the low point, with management guiding for mid-teen revenue declines and another 450 basis point drop in gross margin. Now, with added uncertainty from the tariff situation, I remain cautious even beyond that.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, I assume a 15% revenue decline and an operating margin of 6.5% — down 5.5 points from 2024 and the lowest in over a decade.\n\nBefore reciprocal tariffs were announced, I assumed a gradual recovery: 5% revenue growth and a 10.5% margin by 2030. Even under those more optimistic assumptions, Nike would have only returned to its 2024 earnings by the end of the decade.\n\nGiven everything that’s changed, I’ve now revised those numbers: Just 2% annual revenue growth and a 2030 operating margin of 9%. That would mean that, even five years out, operating margins would be lower than at any point in the last decade, except for 8.3% in 2020 when the Covid pandemic hit.\n\nFrom there, I total Nike’s expected earnings per share and dividends, apply a range of exit multiples, and assign probabilities to reflect different long-term scenarios. No one knows what multiple investors will pay five years from now, but this gives some structure to that uncertainty.\n\nDiscounted back at 8%, the model suggests a fair value of $63 per share — roughly 16.5% above today’s price of $54.\n\nDon’t focus too much on the precise numbers here. For me, the key takeaway is that even if I assume a very grim outlook for the next five years, Nike’s current price seems attractive. Considering the dividend and the buybacks, your total shareholder return, depending on the exit multiple, could look like this (historic P/E between 25-28):\n\nYes, the outlook is cloudy. Yes, more tariff headlines could push the stock lower. But from a long-term perspective, this entry point looks increasingly attractive. \n\nThe bottom line: if you still believe in Nike’s brand, scale, and staying power, the stock offers solid upside from here (i.e., low-to-mid double-digit expected returns annually with very cautious assumptions, looking out 5 years or so)— especially if the turnaround gains traction and the tariffs end up as negotiating leverage, not a long-term policy.\n\nI write free newsletters breaking down different companies like this every week, and I've covered companies like Alphabet, John Deere, Coupang, Airbnb, Ulta, Nintendo, and Hershey's — to see my full archive of company write-ups (for free) or to subscribe and get these posts shared directly with you weekly, visit [this page](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/newsletters/?utm_source=Reddit).

        "selftext": "Hey, lately I have been asking questions about stocks here, and I get such good insights and analysis. Today I wanted to ask you your favorite stock and a quick analysis about it. \n\nI have done my homework and here is mine for this week: **TSM**, might enter again if I find a good entry point. Your turn giveme your best shot!!! \n\n\n\n**MY TSM ANALYSIS:** \n\n**\\*Business Overview:\\*** \n\nTSMC is the world's leading pure-play semiconductor foundry, commanding a 67% market share in contract chip manufacturing and over 90% in advanced chip production. Key clients include Nvidia and Apple. The company is pioneering next-generation 2nm and 1.6nm technologies and investing heavily in global expansion, including a $165 billion commitment to U.S. facilities.\n\n**\\*Growth:\\*** \n\nTSMC has demonstrated strong growth, with a historical Revenue CAGR of 33.9% and EPS CAGR of 37.8%. Q1 2025 revenue surged 41.6% year-over-year, with April 2025 growth reaching 48%. Analysts project a forward growth rate of 60.3%, driven by a forecasted 45% CAGR in AI-related chip demand. TSMC anticipates near-20% revenue CAGR over the next five years. This growth is supported by significant capital investments and the planned launch of advanced 2nm and 1.6nm chips in 2025-2026.\n\n**\\*Profitability:\\*** \n\nTSMC exhibits robust profitability, reflecting its market dominance. Q1 2025 gross margin was 58.8%, and operating margin reached 48.5%, contributing to a 60% year-over-year net profit increase to NT$361.56 billion (43% net margin). Key profitability metrics include a high Return on Invested Capital, a 30% Return on Equity, and TTM Free Cash Flow of NT$870.17 billion.\n\n**\\*Moat:\\*** \n\nTSMC possesses a wide economic moat underpinned by its technological leadership and scale. Its 60-90% market share in advanced chip production, combined with superior process yields (e.g., 2nm and 3nm), makes it an essential, neutral foundry partner for major tech companies. The significant capital expenditures required for advanced fabrication facilities, exemplified by the $100+ billion U.S. expansion, create a substantial barrier to entry.\n\n**\\*Performance & Sentiment:\\***\n\nTSM has delivered strong long-term performance, with the stock up over 200% in the past five years and 20% in the last year. Following a 23% year-to-date decline, the stock has recently rebounded nearly 20% in the past month and broken above its 50-week moving average, signaling a bullish trend. Analyst consensus remains a \"Strong Buy,\" with average target prices around $219.43, indicating significant upside potential. While geopolitical risks and evolving U.S. trade policies remain factors, TSMC's crucial role in meeting AI-driven chip demand and attractive valuation support positive investor sentiment.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Another user wrote a post about why they were bearish on google, and I'm here to explain why they didn't do any research at all and show you why the quality of posts here has gone downhill.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ku780b/gemini\\_has\\_inflated\\_numbers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ku780b/gemini_has_inflated_numbers/)\n\n>Counting every AI powered snippet in Search as a Gemini interaction is inflating the numbers and turning an apples to oranges comparison into something that sounds more impressive than it really is. This only proves my thesis that I am bearish on Google.\n\n**TL,DR/Intro:** Gemini and AI overview numbers are separate, this user didn't do any research & based their opinion on anecdotal comments instead of looking at data. My own personal *opinion* is that Google is currently winning the AI race, and will win in the future, as they simply have access to more compute and models which offer more/equal performance for similar/lower cost of compute. In addition, as others have mentioned, Google has a far greater variety of platforms with which they can integrate Gemini into, further incentivizing usage of the Google product suite and google ecosystem.\n\n**Going deeper (Showing evidence):**\n\nGemini app usage is \\~350 million users a month: [https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/)\n\n>Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot, had 350 million monthly active users around the globe as of March, according to internal data revealed in Google’s ongoing antitrust suit.\n\nAI Overviews usage is \\~1.5 billion users a month, under \"Search\" subheading: [https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q1-2025/#search](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q1-2025/#search)\n\n>In Search, we saw continued double digit revenue growth. AI Overviews is going very well with over 1.5 billion users per month, and we’re excited by the early positive reaction to AI Mode.\n\nGemini vs ChatGPT benchmarks: [https://livebench.ai/#/](https://livebench.ai/#/)\n\n* For this, compare Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google's most powerful reasoning model) to o3 High (OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model): 78 Overall vs 80 Overall\n* And compare Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google's faster, more affordable model) to o4-mini medium (OpenAI's more affordable model). 72 vs 74.5 overall\n* However, a more fair comparison would be between the models free users can get with Google and OpenAI. For Google, free users get access to Gemini 2.5 Pro & Flash, while free users for ChatGPT only get limited access to ChatGPT-4o (Overall 64.65 score).\n* Sources: [https://chatgpt.com/#pricing](https://chatgpt.com/#pricing), and [https://platform.openai.com/docs/models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for how I drew the comparisons.\n\n**Gemini vs ChatGPT Compute Costs**: Gemini compute costs for Google are far less than OpenAI's, demonstrating Google has more cost-efficient models, important for scalability and profitability down the line. Gemini is also trained on Google TPUs while OpenAI relies on Nvidia hardware, which as we all know is sold at a premium.\n\nFor example: Gemini 2.5 Pro compute costs per 1M tokens = $17.50, assuming large input and output prompts. OpenAI's comparable model, o3, costs $25.00 when batching prompts (sending prompts all at once) or $52.50 when not using Batch API. When you look at Flash pricing vs GPT 4.1 pricing, the disparity is even worse considering Flash outperforms GPT 4.1 on Livebench.\n\n* [https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing)\n* [https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3)\n* Add Input/Output costs - regardless of context costs price difference is still in favor of Google\n\nFurther: Google used Trillium TPUs to train Gemini 2.0, and likely used it to train Gemini 2.5 as well.\n\n* [https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga)\n\n>We used Trillium TPUs to train the new [Gemini 2.0](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024), Google’s most capable AI model yet, and now enterprises and startups alike can take advantage of the same powerful, efficient, and sustainable infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI needs more GPUs and has run into issues because of it:\n\n* [https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-has-run-out-of-gpus-says-sam-altman-gpt-4-5-rollout-delayed-due-to-lack-of-processing-power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-has-run-out-of-gpus-says-sam-altman-gpt-4-5-rollout-delayed-due-to-lack-of-processing-power)\n* [https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/oracle-has-reportedly-placed-an-order-for-usd40-billion-in-nvidia-ai-gpus-for-a-new-openai-data-center](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/oracle-has-reportedly-placed-an-order-for-usd40-billion-in-nvidia-ai-gpus-for-a-new-openai-data-center)\n* However, it is important to note that Google does also order prolific numbers of Nvidia GPUs, but do not rely on them as much as OpenAI does due to Google building their own in house TPUs.\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hh2755/microsoft\\_acquired\\_the\\_most\\_nvidia\\_gpus\\_than/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hh2755/microsoft_acquired_the_most_nvidia_gpus_than/) (Yes, I know Reddit isn't the greatest source, but you're reading this, so)\n\nThat's all I'll say for now. The user's previous post & lack of effort/research annoyed me - I spent 30 minutes writing this post but will probably get like 5 upvotes, lol. I know there has been much GOOG discussion here, and I'm sorry to add to it - but please do research before making an uninformed post.",

        "title": "The Very Last: Occidental Petroleum Investment Thesis",
        "selftext": "Dear Redditors,\n\nIn this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.\n\nLet me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…\n\n**What happens when oil prices are high?**\n\nWell, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).\n\nThe redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.\n\nAt the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \\~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said \"this makes sense\" during his annual shareholder meeting.\n\nSo in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).\n\n**What happens when oil prices are low?**\n\nThis is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.\n\n(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. \n\n(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. \n\n(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \\~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That's a noticible amount if it were to going missing, compared to smaller players. Overall, the US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices (geopolitics in part) and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies. Oh, and the Saudi's tried to kill US shale, but failed. Turns out, at the end of the day, economies need their fiscal budgets to balance... except for the US who controls the dollar.\n\n(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy. That said, a tighter mid-cycle range of oil prices is in everyone's best interest.\n\n(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks and decreasing the amount of lendable shares (up to 50%) could help price stability. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.\n\n**What does that leave for the rest of us?**\n\nAssuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.\n\nNow, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.\n\nSome quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).\n\nSo it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?\n\nBelieve it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”\n\nCrazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.\n\nOXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: \n\n1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)\n2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration\n\nI’ll start with the less controversial one…\n\n**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**\n\nIf you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed **ELON MUSK** (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart as Simbol Materials’ commanded a billion dollar valuation (**Jefferies valued them at $2.5 Billion**). Tesla investors familiar with the matter, know that they did not have a billion dollars to throw around at the time. And months later Simbol Materials went bust.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**\n\nThe 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being \"too general\" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and Occidental Petroleum has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech. Let's just say, in a weird twist, the potential Tesla backed Simbol Materials is now backed by Occidental Petroleum and Berkshire Hathaway Energy via a subsidiary called TerraLithium.\n\nAny regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.\n\n**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor (not the only though).**\n\nI have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million on assets that were once valued at **$2.5 billion in 2014 by Jefferies** \\-- with a stronger team now, than 10 years ago. Eventually, they plan on licensing this tech, and let's just say, owning the patents to the tech that can extract half the current global production is probably worth something. And of course lithium prices matter, but the tech is a fixed cost that would be shielded from the *cyclicality* of lithium prices.\n\nNow, onto the more controversial one…\n\n**1PointFive: Carbon Management**\n\nAnti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.\n\nOn May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. \n\nIn the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:\n\n>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.  \nFor a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”\n\nVicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nHowever, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.\n\nThe painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. \n\nLuckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:\n\n>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”\n\nLearning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.\n\n>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.  \nThese synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”\n\nAlong with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.\n\nThe main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.\n\nDespite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.\n\nHowever, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:\n\n>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.  \nThese buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.  \nAs for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”\n\nAt full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. \n\nHowever, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:\n\n1.

To reverse climate change, carbon needs to be removed from the air.\n\n*That is a fact.*\n\nThere are a handful of startups that remove carbon from the air, but their solutions can only remove **tens** of thousands of metric tons. To be blunt, all of their solutions are subscale and fall short of even putting a dent into reversing climate change.\n\nHowever, Stratos' scale is to the tune of **hundreds** of thousands. At full capacity, Stratos can remove \\~500,000 metric tons of carbon per year while running on green energy.\n\n*Stratos' scale blows out the competition by over 10 times the capacity.*\n\nAnd unlike trees, OXY *can* optimize DAC plants to be built, smaller, cheaper, and faster. If this tech improves, it would only take a few thousand of these DAC plants to reverse climate change.\n\n*OXY, via their subsidiary 1Point5, is both well capitlized and vertically integrated to scale DAC and fight climate change.*\n\n**History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.**\n\nCrazy or not, I believe buying OXY now is like buying Nvidia.\n\nNvidia’s GPUs have proven various use cases from gaming, crypto, to AI, where the core gaming business was rather unattractive.\n\n*Before Nvidia's enormous run, analysts valued Nvidia's GPUs potential in crypto and AI at basically 0.*\n\nSimilarly, OXY’s expertise in carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech has proven various use cases from carbon based enhanced oil recovery, lithium extraction, carbon sequestration, and carbon removal tech.\n\n*Currently analysts value Direct Lithium Extraction tech and a transtion to Carbon Management at 0.* \n\nWhat baffles me is that Nvidia’s growth is fueled by **speculative demand** for crypto and artificial intelligence. The world has yet to see returns, but plans on spending $1 trillion over the next few years on AI hoping the economics will work out.\n\n*If that isn’t speculation, I don’t know what is.*\n\nAnd believe me, I understand this tech more than you ever would think. A colleague of mine who has a PhD in CS told me exactly the many use cases of GPUs, but I didn't buy it because: (1) I viewed AI as speculative. (2) Because of reason 1, I expected companies to invest slowly and cautiously. I mean, just look at how the market reacted to Mark Zuckerberg's push into the Metaverse. (3) Because of reason 1 and 2, I expected a slow growth rate where Nvidia's moat would erode in a 3 to 5 year time frame to competitors (something that is happening as we speak -- i.e. CUDA on AMD) before Nvidia could make a killing.\n\nIn fact, my stance on tech in general can be summarized as so:\n\n>The reality of tech companies is that they age rapidly — like dog years squared. Moats flash in and out of existence within 2 to 3 years time (along with their valuations). The odds of finding the next Oracle are slim to none, because it's almost certain that the world will never rely on a single relational database architecture again. The main worries in tech are competition, growth, value-cre-ation, and value-ation. When competition enters the space, investors should pack their bags since the rapid democratization of information allows competition to grow at lightning speeds. Ironically, the forever holdings are businesses that are entrenched usually for non-technological reasons (i.e Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, Palantir). And lack of technical and algorithmic literacy, makes the chances of accurately determining an enduring business at early stages next to none.\n\nWith the release of ChatGPT, you can imagine where I went wrong... At that point, I should've just bought the damn company since the growth was obviously higher than I anticipated completely invalidating my original thoughts. But I digress, the focus of this letter isn't about me confessing my sins for missing out on Nvidia...\n\nNvidia aside, Occidental Petroleum’s growth is fueled by **non-speculative demand**:\n\n(1) Lithium independence is a bipartisan goal, and lithium demand is very healthy with our tech boom.\n\n(2) Climate change keeps getting worse. Reducing emission slows it, but to reversing it requires the atmosphere to be decarbonized which is a very healthy tailwind for a growing carbon credit market that OXY can dominate.\n\n(3) Due to oil being sytemically ingrained into the world, the clean energy transition is very slow. So I can sleep knowing that tomorrow oil will still be here.\n\nOverall, I buy whenever OXY nears ***single*** digit earnings multiples or reaches an acceptable free cash flow yield (adjusted for things I deem reasonable like Warren's preferred shares, because there’s cash flow and then there’s cash flow I get).\n\nFor me OXY is a safe vehicle to park my money while I wait for other opportunities. And until then, I will just be clipping coupons.\n\nSo yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...\n\nFrom,\n\nYetAnotherSpeculator\n\n\\#NotFinancialAdvice\n\n**\\[Amendment; January 27, 2025\\]** Please re-read my stance on tech. In a mere 2 years AI investment, we are at a crossroads with Nvidia v.s. DeepSeek. I believe this letter speaks for itself. As for what's going to happen?  I have no fucking clue, but I do not believe natural market forces are in play.\n\n**\\[Amendment; April 9, 2025\\]** In an ironic turn of events, an orange man is shilling EVs and about to tank US shale. So much for \"Drill, baby drill.\" Now, I have no doubt that lower oil prices equals less oil production. **But, if US shale falters, there will be massive ramifications**. There is a reason why the stock market is declining rapidly. There is an old man fondling economic nukes, putting the world on the brink of economic instability we have not seen since the pandemic. The fear is real, and opportunity is already appearing. Perhaps there's a reason why Berkshire was making small bets on beer, pizza, and pools... in any event, depending on how long these tarriffs persist, US shale is one of the last places you want to be...\n\n**\\[Amendment; May 14, 2025\\]** As Warren Buffett said himself, this market volatility is nothing. Had you seen my revisions, I swung massive handsomely into a small oil company in the state of California and let’s just say have done quite well since during this recovery. As for where i put those gains, OXY is neither on nor off the table, but other opportunities can and will exist. oil is a commodity and volatile, but it works in both directions. but one thing won’t change and that’s how important OXY is to reducing the deficit…\n\n**\\[Amendment; June 15, 2025\\]** From doom and gloom tariff induced oil price winter, to Israel has targeting Iran energy infrastructure, only time will tell where oil prices go. In the meantime, OXY is making steady progress right sizing the balance sheet and it’s carbon management initiatives. Though the trailing P/E is nothing to scoff at… overall i would use P/E as a proxy, given how volatile a commodity like oil is…",

Companies like Google Cloud have already begun accepting stablecoin payments from customers, while others like Airbnb and X are in talks with crypto companies about potential integrations.\n\n\n\nThe adoption of stablecoins by Big Tech firms could be a significant development in the crypto industry, providing legitimacy and credibility to the asset class. However, there are also challenges ahead, including deciding which stablecoins to integrate and navigating regulatory hurdles.",

Instead, I’m getting a lot of private messages from people who say they’re interested in buying the cards. I’m wondering if this is typical when selling gift cards online, or if it’s a sign that I should be cautious. I’ve heard that scammers often reach out privately, sometimes pretending to be legitimate buyers, and then try to get the card codes or personal information before actually sending payment. I’d really appreciate any advice or stories from others who have tried to sell Apple gift cards—did you also get mostly private messages, and how did you determine if the buyers were trustworthy? I want to avoid falling for any scams, especially since I’ve read that once you share the codes, the money can be gone for good. What steps can I take to protect myself and make sure I’m dealing with real buyers? Any tips or recommended platforms for selling safely would be really helpful.",

        "selftext": "If you invest in crypto, you cannot say you’ve done your research unless you’ve read this thesis on tokenization, published by Larry Fink today in the annual investor letter for BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager.\n\nFor context, BlackRock manages over $11 Trillion in assets and is one of the top shareholders in just about any company you’ve ever heard of. They led the launch of Bitcoin ETFs followed by Ethereum ETFs. They launched their BUIDL fund for on-chain asset management, which has already surpassed over $2B in AUM on Ethereum.\n\nDo yourself a favor and read it below:\n\n**Tokenization is democratization**\n\nThe world’s money moves through plumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary.\nTake the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). It’s the system that underpins trillions of dollars in global transactions every day, and it works much like a relay race: Banks hand off instructions one by one, meticulously checking details at each step. That relay approach made sense in the 1970s, an analog era when the markets were much smaller and daily transactions were much fewer. But today, relying on SWIFT feels like routing emails through the postal office.\n\nTokenization changes all that. If SWIFT is the postal service, tokenization is email itself—assets move directly and instantly, sidestepping intermediaries.\n\nWhat exactly is tokenization? It's turning real-world assets—stocks, bonds, real estate—into digital tokens tradable online. Each token certifies your ownership of a specific asset, much like a digital deed. Unlike traditional paper certificates, these tokens live securely on a blockchain, enabling instant buying, selling, and transferring without cumbersome paperwork or waiting periods.\n\nEvery stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn't need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, tokenization makes investing much more democratic.\n\n- **It can democratize access.**\nTokenization allows for fractional ownership. That means assets could be sliced into infinitely small pieces. This lowers one of the barriers to investing in valuable, previously inaccessible assets like private real estate and private equity.\n\n- **It can democratize shareholder voting.**\nWhen you own a stock, you have a right to vote on the company’s shareholder proposals. Tokenization makes that easier because your ownership and voting rights are digitally tracked, allowing you to vote seamlessly and securely from anywhere.\n\n- **It can democratize yield.**\nSome investments produce much higher returns than others, but only big investors can get into them. One reason? Friction. Legal, operational, bureaucratic. Tokenization strips that away, allowing more people access to potentially higher returns.\n\n**One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs—provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification.**\n\nFinancial transactions demand rigorous identity checks. Apple Pay and credit cards handle identity verification effortlessly, billions of times a day. Trade venues like NYSE and MarketAxess manage to do the same for buying and selling securities. But tokenized assets won’t run through those traditional channels, meaning we need a new digital identity verification system. It sounds complex, but India, the world’s most populous country, has already done it. Today, over 90% of Indians can securely verify transactions directly from their smartphones. The takeaway is clear. If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. We must solve digital verification, too.",

        "selftext": "Michael Saylor gave an interview in which he was asked about the potential risks that quantum computers could pose to Bitcoin.\n\nStating „If in 10-20 years there is a hyperpowerful computer that threatens modern cryptography the answer is network, hardware and software upgrades“, he completely neglects the fact that his so-called „modern“ cryptography such as ECDSA will be long-obsolete by then as per NIST, which advises to decommission this algorithm by 2030 latest and replace it by a quantum-resistant counterpart.\n\nHe also states that Bitcoin „will just upgrade its software“ as Microsoft and Google will when it’s time, but disregards that it’s way harder to upgrade for Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature, where consensus has to be agreed on first. Especially concerning the major question of how to handle legacy addresses, whose public keys have been exposed, making them vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer in the future. All that while Google and Apple are proactively implementing the new quantum-safe NIST-approved algorithms already.\n\nHim saying „It‘s the hardest thing in the universe to hack“ just gives me „The titanic cannot be sunk“ kind of vibes. And saying it’s encryption is stronger than Google is just a straight-up lie.\n\nI can’t imagine he is not aware of all this, which makes me really question his authenticity in the Bitcoin community. It should be in his interest to make Bitcoin future-proof in order to secure the protocol and its investors. And he, as the face of Bitcoin, should take the leading role in ensuring that Bitcoin will reach its goal to be the future store-of-value and replace gold instead of downplaying potential future threats.",

        "selftext": "Hey r/Cryptocurrency community, I’m Tony, the founder of Obyte. Happy to introduce you to Obyte, if you’ve never heard about it, or heard too long ago.\n\nObyte is a DAG based cryptocurrency platform. What makes it different from other platforms is that power is decentralized here. Due to being based on DAG (Directed acyclic graph), every user in Obyte has the power to add their transactions directly to the ledger, with no middlemen involved. This is different from blockchains, where block producers are the power centers and middlemen that have the power to accept or not accept transactions into their blocks (to censor them).\n\nObyte stays true to the original cypherpunk and crypto-anarchist values of individual autonomy, independence from big power centers, and privacy. For me, that was what drew me to crypto when I first got involved in 2014. Unfortunately, now it seems to have lost its way and shifted to getting-rich-quick, institutional money, ETFs, and hyper-financialization.\n\nWe want to get crypto back to its cypherpunk roots.\n\nTo rebuild the community centered around these values we recently launched a cypherpunk-themed Obyte City, where community members establish closer connections with one another when they become neighbors in the City (along with earning some rewards). The idea is that stronger horizontal connections — independent of the team — make a stronger community.

It fell to my friend and colleague Rafail Ostrovsky to organize the workshop, which ended up being held last week. When Rafi invited me to give the opening talk, I knew he’d keep emailing until I said yes. So, on the 3-hour flight to LAX, I wrote the following talk in a spiral notebook, which I then delivered the next morning with no slides. I called it “Quantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype.” I thought Shtetl-Optimized readers might be interested too, since it contains my reflections on a quarter-century in quantum computing, and prognostications on what I expect soon. Enjoy, and let me know what you think!\n\n\n\nQuantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype\n\nby Scott Aaronson\n\nSeptember 16, 2024\n\n\n\nWhen Rafi invited me to open this event, it sounded like he wanted big-picture pontification more than technical results, which is just as well, since I’m getting old for the latter. Also, I’m just now getting back into quantum computing after a two-year leave at OpenAI to think about the theoretical foundations of AI safety. Luckily for me, that was a relaxing experience, since not much happened in AI these past two years. \\[Pause for laughs\\] So then, did anything happen in quantum computing while I was away?\n\n\n\nThis, of course, has been an extraordinary time for both quantum computing and AI, and not only because the two fields were mentioned for the first time in an American presidential debate (along with, I think, the problem of immigrants eating pets). But it’s extraordinary for quantum computing and for AI in very different ways. In AI, practice is wildly ahead of theory, and there’s a race for scientific understanding to catch up to where we’ve gotten via the pure scaling of neural nets and the compute and data used to train them. In quantum computing, it’s just the opposite: there’s right now a race for practice to catch up to where theory has been since the mid-1990s.\n\n\n\nI started in quantum computing around 1998, which is not quite as long as some people here, but which does cover most of the time since Shor’s algorithm and the rest were discovered. So I can say: this past year or two is the first time I’ve felt like the race to build a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer is actually underway. Like people are no longer merely giving talks about the race or warming up for the race, but running the race.\n\n\n\nWithin just the last few weeks, we saw the group at Google announce that they’d used the Kitaev surface code, with distance 7, to encode one logical qubit using 100 or so physical qubits, in superconducting architecture. They got a net gain: their logical qubit stays alive for maybe twice as long as the underlying physical qubits do. And crucially, they find that their logical coherence time increases as they pass to larger codes, with higher distance, on more physical qubits. With superconducting, there are still limits to how many physical qubits you can stuff onto a chip, and eventually you’ll need communication of qubits between chips, which has yet to be demonstrated. But if you could scale Google’s current experiment even to 1500 physical qubits, you’d probably be below the threshold where you could use that as a building block for a future scalable fault-tolerant device.\n\n\n\nThen, just last week, a collaboration between Microsoft and Quantinuum announced that, in the trapped-ion architecture, they applied pretty substantial circuits to logically-encoded qubits—-again in a way that gets a net gain in fidelity over not doing error-correction, modulo a debate about whether they’re relying too much on postselection. So, they made a GHZ state, which is basically like a Schrödinger cat, out of 12 logically encoded qubits. They also did a “quantum chemistry simulation,” which had only two logical qubits, but which required three logical non-Clifford gates—which is the hard kind of gate when you’re doing error-correction.\n\n\n\nBecause of these advances, as well as others—what QuEra is doing with neutral atoms, what PsiQuantum and Xanadu are doing with photonics, etc.—I’m now more optimistic than I’ve ever been that, if things continue at the current rate, either there are useful fault-tolerant QCs in the next decade, or else something surprising happens to stop that. Plausibly we’ll get there not just with one hardware architecture, but with multiple ones, much like the Manhattan Project got a uranium bomb and a plutonium bomb around the same time, so the question will become which one is most economic.\n\n\n\nIf someone asks me why I’m now so optimistic, the core of the argument is 2-qubit gate fidelities. We’ve known for years that, at least on paper, quantum fault-tolerance becomes a net win (that is, you sustainably correct errors faster than you introduce new ones) once you have physical 2-qubit gates that are \\~99.99% reliable. The problem has “merely” been how far we were from that. When I entered the field, in the late 1990s, it would’ve been like a Science or Nature paper to do a 2-qubit gate with 50% fidelity. But then at some point the 50% became 90%, became 95%, became 99%, and within the past year, multiple groups have reported 99.9%. So, if you just plot the log of the infidelity as a function of year and stare at it—yeah, you’d feel pretty optimistic about the next decade too!\n\n\n\nOr pessimistic, as the case may be! To any of you who are worried about post-quantum cryptography—by now I’m so used to delivering a message of, maybe, eventually, someone will need to start thinking about migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack. I think today that message needs to change. I think today the message needs to be: yes, unequivocally, worry about this now. Have a plan.\n\n\n\nSo, I think this moment is a good one for reflection. We’re used to quantum computing having this air of unreality about it. Like sure, we go to conferences, we prove theorems about these complexity classes like BQP and QMA, the experimenters do little toy demos that don’t scale. But if this will ever be practical at all, then for all we know, not for another 200 years. It feels really different to think of this as something plausibly imminent. So what I want to do for the rest of this talk is to step back and ask, what are the main reasons why people regarded this as not entirely real? And what can we say about those reasons in light of where we are today?\n\n\n\nReason #1\n\n\n\nFor the general public, maybe the overriding reason not to take QC seriously has just been that it sounded too good to be true. Like, great, you’ll have this magic machine that’s gonna exponentially speed up every problem in optimization and machine learning and finance by trying out every possible solution simultaneously, in different parallel universes. Does it also dice peppers?\n\n\n\nFor this objection, I’d say that our response hasn’t changed at all in 30 years, and it’s simply, “No, that’s not what it will do and not how it will work.” We should acknowledge that laypeople and journalists and unfortunately even some investors and government officials have been misled by the people whose job it was to explain this stuff to them.\n\n\n\nI think it’s important to tell people that the only hope of getting a speedup from a QC is to exploit the way that QM works differently from classical probability theory — in particular, that it involves these numbers called amplitudes, which can be positive, negative, or even complex. With every quantum algorithm, what you’re trying to do is choreograph a pattern of interference where for each wrong answer, the contributions to its amplitude cancel each other out, whereas the contributions to the amplitude of the right answer reinforce each other. The trouble is, it’s only for a few practical problems that we know how to do that in a way that vastly outperforms the best known classical algorithms.\n\n\n\nWhat are those problems? Here, for all the theoretical progress that’s been made in these past decades, I’m going to give the same answer in 2024 that I would’ve given in 1998. Namely, there’s the simulation of chemistry, materials, nuclear physics, or anything else where many-body quantum effects matter. This was Feynman’s original application from 1981, but probably still the most important one commercially. It could plausibly help with batteries, drugs, solar cells, high-temperature superconductors, all kinds of other things, maybe even in the next few years.\n\n\n\nAnd then there’s breaking public-key cryptography, which is not commercially important, but is important for other reasons well-known to everyone here.\n\n\n\nAnd then there’s everything else. For problems in optimization, machine learning, finance, and so on, there’s typically a Grover’s speedup, but that of course is “only” a square root and not an exponential, which means that it will take much longer before it’s relevant in practice. And one of the earliest things we learned in quantum computing theory is that there’s no “black-box” way to beat the Grover speedup. By the way, that’s also relevant to breaking cryptography — other than the subset of cryptography that’s based on abelian groups and can be broken by Shor’s algorithm or the like. The centerpiece of my PhD thesis, twenty years ago, was the theorem that you can’t get more than a Grover-type polynomial speedup for the black-box problem of finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions.\n\n\n\nSo then what remains? Well, there are all sorts heuristic quantum algorithms for classical optimization and machine learning problems — QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), quantum annealing, and so on — and we can hope that sometimes they’ll beat the best classical heuristics for the same problems, but it will be trench warfare, not just magically speeding up everything. There are lots of quantum algorithms somehow inspired by the HHL (Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd) algorithm for solving linear systems, and we can hope that some of those algorithms will get exponential speedups for end-to-end problems that matter, as opposed to problems of transforming one quantum state to another quantum state. We can of course hope that new quantum algorithms will be discovered. And most of all, we can look for entirely new problem domains, where people hadn’t even considered using quantum computers before—new orchards in which to pick low-hanging fruit. Recently, Shih-Han Hung and I, along with others, have proposed using current QCs to generate cryptographically certified random numbers, which could be used in post-state cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. I’m hopeful that people will find other protocol applications of QC like that one — “proof of quantum work.” \\[Another major potential protocol application, which Dan Boneh brought up after my talk, is quantum one-shot signatures.\\]\n\n\n\nAnyway, taken together, I don’t think any of this is too good to be true. I think it’s genuinely good and probably true!\n\n\n\nReason #2\n\n\n\nA second reason people didn’t take seriously that QC was actually going to happen was the general thesis of technological stagnation, at least in the physical world. You know, maybe in the 40s and 50s, humans built entirely new types of machines, but nowadays what do we do? We issue press releases. We make promises. We argue on social media.\n\n\n\nNowadays, of course, pessimism about technological progress seems hard to square with the revolution that’s happening in AI, another field that spent decades being ridiculed for unfulfilled promises and that’s now fulfilling the promises. I’d also speculate that, to the extent there is technological stagnation, most of it is simply that it’s become really hard to build new infrastructure—high-speed rail, nuclear power plants, futuristic cities—for legal reasons and NIMBY reasons and environmental review reasons and Baumol’s cost disease reasons. But none of that really applies to QC, just like it hasn’t applied so far to AI.\n\n\n\nReason #3\n\n\n\nA third reason people didn’t take this seriously was the sense of “It’s been 20 years already, where’s my quantum computer?” QC is often compared to fusion power, another technology that’s “eternally just over the horizon.” (Except, I’m no expert, but there seems to be dramatic progress these days in fusion power too!)\n\n\n\nMy response to the people who make that complaint was always, like, how much do you know about the history of technology? It took more than a century for heavier-than-air flight to go from correct statements of the basic principle to reality. Universal programmable classical computers surely seemed more fantastical from the standpoint of 1920 than quantum computers seem today, but then a few decades later they were built. Today, AI provides a particularly dramatic example where ideas were proposed a long time ago—neural nets, backpropagation—those ideas were then written off as failures, but no, we now know that the ideas were perfectly sound; it just took a few decades for the scaling of hardware to catch up to the ideas. That’s why this objection never had much purchase by me, even before the dramatic advances in experimental quantum error-correction of the last year or two.\n\n\n\nReason #4\n\n\n\nA fourth reason why people didn’t take QC seriously is that, a century after the discovery of QM, some people still harbor doubts about quantum mechanics itself. Either they explicitly doubt it, like Leonid Levin, Roger Penrose, or Gerard ‘t Hooft. Or they say things like, “complex Hilbert space in 2n dimensions is a nice mathematical formalism, but mathematical formalism is not reality”—the kind of thing you say when you want to doubt, but not take full intellectual responsibility for your doubts.\n\n\n\nI think the only thing for us to say in response, as quantum computing researchers—and the thing I consistently have said—is man, we welcome that confrontation! Let’s test quantum mechanics in this new regime. And if, instead of building a QC, we have to settle for “merely” overthrowing quantum mechanics and opening up a new era in physics—well then, I guess we’ll have to find some way to live with that.\n\n\n\nReason #5\n\n\n\nMy final reason why people didn’t take QC seriously is the only technical one I’ll discuss here. Namely, maybe quantum mechanics is fine but fault-tolerant quantum computing is fundamentally “screened off” or “censored” by decoherence or noise—and maybe the theory of quantum fault-tolerance, which seemed to indicate the opposite, makes unjustified assumptions. This has been the position of Gil Kalai, for example.\n\n\n\nThe challenge for that position has always been to articulate, what is true about the world instead? Can every realistic quantum system be simulated efficiently by a classical computer? If so, how? What is a model of correlated noise that kills QC without also killing scalable classical computing?—which turns out to be a hard problem.\n\n\n\nIn any case, I think this position has been dealt a severe blow by the Random Circuit Sampling quantum supremacy experiments of the past five years. Scientifically, the most important thing we’ve learned from these experiments is that the fidelity seems to decay exponentially with the number of qubits, but “only” exponentially — as it would if the errors were independent from one gate to the next, precisely as the theory of quantum fault-tolerance assumes. So for anyone who believes this objection, I’d say that the ball is now firmly in their court.\n\n\n\nSo, if we accept that QC is on the threshold of becoming real, what are the next steps? There are the obvious ones: push forward with building better hardware and using it to demonstrate logical qubits and fault-tolerant operations on them. Continue developing better error-correction methods. Continue looking for new quantum algorithms and new problems for those algorithms to solve.\n\n\n\nBut there’s also a less obvious decision right now. Namely, do we put everything into fault-tolerant qubits, or do we continue trying to demonstrate quantum advantage in the NISQ (pre-fault-tolerant) era? There’s a case to be made that fault-tolerance will ultimately be needed for scaling, and anything you do without fault-tolerance is some variety of non-scalable circus trick, so we might as well get over the hump now.\n\n\n\nBut I’d like to advocate putting at least some thought into how to demonstrate a quantum advantage in the near-term. Thay could be via cryptographic protocols, like those that Kahanamoku-Meyer et al. have proposed. It could be via pseudorandom peaked quantum circuits, a recent proposal by me and Yuxuan Zhang—if we can figure out an efficient way to generate the circuits. Or we could try to demonstrate what William Kretschmer, Harry Buhrman, and I have called “quantum information supremacy,” where, instead of computational advantage, you try to do an experiment that directly shows the vastness of Hilbert space, via exponential advantages for quantum communication complexity, for example. I’m optimistic that that might be doable in the very near future, and have been working with Quantinuum to try to do it.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, when I started in quantum computing 25 years ago, I reconciled myself to the prospect that I’m going to study what fundamental physics implies about the limits of computation, and maybe I’ll never live to see any of it experimentally tested, and that’s fine. On the other hand, once you tell me that there is a serious prospect of testing it soon, then I become kind of impatient. Some part of me says, let’s do this! Let’s try to achieve forthwith what I’ve always regarded as the #1 application of quantum computers, more important than codebreaking or even quantum simulation: namely, disproving the people who said that scalable quantum computing was impossible.",

        "title": "What needs to happen for crypto to become mainstream and a currency used more frequent ",
        "selftext": "Hear me out. This is not an Anti crypto or Bitcoin post. But this is a post regarding the complexity of bitcoin and storage for the average or novice crypto holder/trader. Will how Bitcoin is stored and or traded ever become easier so that the mainstream average person or older people can buy/trade/hold bitcoin. Now when you read this. You are coming from an advanced or better understanding of crypto than me or the average person. I have bought and or held crypto since 2016ish. I know little about cold wallets and I am just now setting up a trezor for my kids so that I can pass on btc to them for part of their inheritance. I believe like most of you that the value will increase. That's not the point of this discussion. What needs to happen or will happen so Bitcoin is more adaptable or usable for the average person. Ask any of your friends and I bet 50% or higher don't have a clue about what blockchain even is. Then ask them about cold storage for their crypto. If Bitcoin is going to become mainstream and become a larger token used for currency, it will have to become easier for the public to grasp and not get frustrated and give up trying to understand the complexity of what crypto/bitcoin is and how to store it safely so it can't be hacked.\n\nYou reading this and being familiar with how everything I have mentioned works, this might seem like a stretch. But if your grandparents or Joe blow is going to use crypto. It will have to become much easier to grasp and store it safely. Just setting up my wallet there is seed phrases, 12-24 word passwords, hidden wallets, default wallets, seed words I need to store and keep private to access my wallet and acct. not a chance 50% of the elderly can safely invest a decent part of their retirement in crypto and store it safely without a lot of help and at best they will be confused about the set up and not follow through. The more people involved in crypto, the quicker it becomes mainstream and prices grow even higher. Just a quick glance on the internet and billions of crypto is still being hacked and stolen each year. \n\nThis is concerning to someone who is moving $6-7 figures in crypto to store in a wallet or cold storage. I lost $13k in 2020 or so by having random coins I had to sell then convert to this token from that token to cash out in cash. I sent coins from a wrong coin to another coin address and I was SOL. Lost that money and even hired a crypto attorney to see if they could recover my funds. Apparently once it went into that coin or wallet by my own doing and accident, There was no recovering them. \n\nAgain that's not part of this discussion but the complexity of some trading could result is large losses. The average retiree won't be willing to put 1/3 or 1/2 their retirement into a coin or system that they will need training and help setting up a wallet to store their funds. My long winded post comes to the question. What can or will have to happen for btc to become mainstream enough the average or novice investor feels safe enough to be able to buy in and place part of their retirement in crypto. \n\n\nSetting up phrases then passworkd phrases to get in your trezor that can't be stored online for fear of hacking will scare your average investor. You reading this think this is foreign thinking because you have a basic or even advance understanding of crypto buying, sending and storing. Even now as I am setting up a tree safe 5, I am a little concerned about what I can do online in regards to being connected to the internet and what can and can't be hacked. So I store my words for my acct and trezor in a safe. How do you safely store your words and info in the case you pass away and need to transfer your assets to your kids. I don't think you want to store the words or passwords to your accts in your trust or will, people have access to that. I know there are stampings and metal plates you can store your passwords on but who and where do you trust to keep those. \n\nYour average 60-80 year old who is retired or close to retiring won't feel safe putting 6-7 figures in a system that is this complex to learn for a novice. I buy stocks , I pass away, my kids inherit my accts and they can keep or liquidate the stocks for liquid. I pass away and give them a cold storage wallet with the passwords and how to access the btc, that's a burden they now have to learn. Will crypto always be so complicated for those who don't spend time learning all the ins-outs of security. Buying Microsoft or Apple stock is simple enough. \n\nI can go to cashapp and buy stocks . I've been investing in stocks and various assets for 35 years, I've never been so worried about am I doing this and that right not to lose or have my btc hacked. Will the system ever become easy and mainstream enough that a lot of this fear is removed. I know debit cards are stolen and checking accts hacked, money moved. But your average person isn't near as worried about that as they are losing their crypto. I read between 6-17% of adults own crypto, that number needs to skyrocket to become mainstream. \n\nLook at the prices now, think of 50-60-80% of adults who own crypto, what that would do to the price. For crypto to become a mainstream form of currency. A lot of this fear and difficulty needs to be removed. Some of you reading this since you understand this will think this post is over the top. I assure you if you ask 50 people most of them have 2 concerns. How to buy and send and how to store it safely. Until that fear eases. Will crypto ever reach the price predictions some say if the average person can't buy, trade and store crypto without these worries. Again I own crypto. Will buy crypto, will store it to pass to my kids one day. But I feel the complexity of how to do this reamains one of the sticking points to what needs to become easier so the price reaches insane highs while removing the doubt of will I lose my crypto. \n\nAny thoughts if or how crypto becomes easier for the average Joe or retiree to buy and store becomes easier. Sorry for the long winded post but I hope you get the jist of the post.\n\nEdit to post****+\nJust to add to the complexity. I just ordered a tezor safe 5 and I had to cancel the order. I don't own a computer, only an iPhone and iPad. I trade 7 figures worth of stocks and options a week off an iPad but can't run a cold wallet from an iPad. This has to become easier and more mainstream . I can log in my bank acct with my iPad. Transfer or wire 6 figures to my investing acct. trade stocks. Sell stocks, wire the money back to my bank acct. buy bitcoin on cashapp and coinbase on my iPad but not use it for cold storage. Head scratching. ",

        "selftext": "[\\[source wikipedia\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Personal_life)\n\n# Engagement\n\nIn 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague [Joan Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Clarke), a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly \"unfazed\" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.[^(\\[162\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-163)\n\n# Homosexuality and indecency conviction\n\nIn December 1951, Turing met Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing was walking along Manchester's [Oxford Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmslow_Road) when he met Murray just outside the [Regal Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehouse) and invited him to lunch. The two agreed to meet again and in January 1952 began an intimate relationship.[^(\\[163\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-164) On 23 January, Turing's house in Wilmslow was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[^(\\[164\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-165) and both men were charged with \"[gross indecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_indecency)\" under [Section 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885#Section_11) of the [Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885).[^(\\[165\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-LeavittP268-166) Initial [committal proceedings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committal_procedure) for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor \"reserved his defence\", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. The proceedings were held at the [Sessions House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sessions_House,_Knutsford) in [Knutsford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knutsford).[^(\\[166\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-167)\n\nTuring was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.[^(\\[167\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-168) The case, [*Regina*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) *v. Turing and Murray,* was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[^(\\[168\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-169) Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo [hormonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone) physical changes designed to reduce [libido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido), known as \"[chemical castration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration)\".[^(\\[169\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-:2-170) He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as [diethylstilbestrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol) or DES), a synthetic [oestrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oestrogen); this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing [impotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impotence) and caused [breast tissue to form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecomastia).[^(\\[170\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-171) In a letter, Turing wrote that \"no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out\".[^(\\[171\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-172)[^(\\[172\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-173) Murray was given a conditional discharge.[^(\\[173\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-174)\n\nTuring's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the [Government Communications Headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters) (GCHQ), the British [signals intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_intelligence) agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic post. His trial took place only months after the defection to the Soviet Union of [Guy Burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Burgess) and [Donald Maclean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Maclean_(spy)), in summer 1951, after which the Foreign Office started to consider anyone known to be homosexual as a potential security risk.[^(\\[174\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-175)\n\nTuring was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries.[^(\\[175\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-176) In the summer of 1952 he visited Norway which was more tolerant of homosexuals. Among the various men he met there was one named Kjell Carlson. Kjell intended to visit Turing in the UK but the authorities intercepted Kjell's postcard detailing his travel arrangements and were able to intercept and deport him before the two could meet.[^(\\[176\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-olinick13-177) It was also during this time that Turing started consulting a psychiatrist, Dr Franz Greenbaum, with whom he got on well and who subsequently became a family friend.[^(\\[176\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-olinick13-177)[^(\\[177\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-dowd-178)\n\n# Death\n\nOn 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, [Wilmslow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmslow), Turing's housekeeper found him dead.[^(\\[178\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-copperfolly-179) A post mortem was held that evening, which determined that he had died the previous day at age 41 with [cyanide poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning) cited as the cause of death.[^(\\[179\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-180)[^(\\[180\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-181) When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[^(\\[181\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-182) it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose.\n\n# ",

        "selftext": "Just five years ago, the idea of cooperation between crypto exchanges and traditional banks seemed far. One represented decentralization the other, stability and institutional structure. But times have changed and quickly. Today, banks that ignore the integration of crypto functionality aren’t just missing out on innovation - they’re risking becoming irrelevant and outdated.\n\nAs digital finance accelerates, crypto is no longer just a curiosity. It’s becoming infrastructure. And for traditional banks, working with crypto exchanges is turning from an idea into a strategic necessity.\n\nMost of the crypto exchanges are already in close collaboration with neobanks:\n\n**Kraken partnered with Bunq** \\- [https://thefintechtimes.com/bunq-partners-with-kraken-to-launch-in-app-crypto-investment-capabilities/](https://thefintechtimes.com/bunq-partners-with-kraken-to-launch-in-app-crypto-investment-capabilities/)\n\n**Bybit with MasterCard** \\- [https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/92c35-mastercard-teams-up-with-bybit-to-introduce-new-crypto-powered-debit-card](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/92c35-mastercard-teams-up-with-bybit-to-introduce-new-crypto-powered-debit-card)\n\n**WhiteBIT collaborated with Misyon** \\- [https://crypto.news/whitebit-tr-partners-with-misyon-bank-amid-turkeys-rapidly-changing-crypto-landscape/](https://crypto.news/whitebit-tr-partners-with-misyon-bank-amid-turkeys-rapidly-changing-crypto-landscape/)\n\nAnd many others have joined the trend recently or a long time ago already.\n\n**Banks and Crypto Aren’t Enemies. They’re Becoming Partners**\n\nWith trillions in market capitalization and growing adoption among both retail and institutional investors, it’s clear that crypto is here to stay. Customers want to manage their finance and crypto assets in the same place. They expect flexibility, transparency, and 24/7 accessibility: features that traditional banking has long promised, but not always delivered.  \nThat’s where crypto exchange integration comes in. Rather than building blockchain infrastructure from scratch, banks are increasingly partnering with exchanges to embed crypto services into their offerings.\n\n# Why does it matter strategically for banks?\n\nRetaining the Next Generation of Customers. Millennials and Gen Z are growing up with crypto as part of their financial reality. If banks don’t offer these services, they’ll lose customers to others that do.  \nCompetition with the giants. Tech giants like Apple, PayPal, and Revolut are already integrating crypto features. To stay relevant, banks need to do more than just keep up.\n\nNew revenue opportunities. Integrating digital assets can unlock new revenue opportunities for banks.  \nPositioning as Innovation Leaders. Offering crypto functionality isn’t just about technology. It tells customers and the market: we’re evolving, we’re relevant and we’re here for the long term.\n\n\\**Forward-thinking banks are no longer building walls. They’re building bridges. \\**\n\nCrypto exchanges are proving to be some of the most valuable partners in that construction process. By integrating with crypto exchanges, traditional banks can transform themselves. More agile. More responsive. More aligned with what modern finance actually looks like.\n\n***The question is no longer whether banks will engage with crypto. The real question is: will they lead, or will they follow?***\n\n  \nC - Christopher Wells",

        "title": "RizzFi: Injecting Culture and Confidence into DeFi",
        "selftext": "In the vast landscape of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), most conversations revolve around technology, market trends, and protocol security. It's a space filled with innovation, but also heavy jargon, sterile branding, and an overload of charts. While these elements are essential for understanding and navigating the crypto world, they rarely speak to the identity and culture of the people building and participating in these ecosystems.\n\nThat’s where a concept like RizzFi comes in — a project, or better said, a movement, that explores the fusion of financial intelligence with cultural resonance and personal branding. But before we dig deeper into what RizzFi represents, let’s take a step back and talk about what’s missing in DeFi right now.\n\nWhere's the Culture in Crypto?\n\nDeFi is revolutionary. It has democratized access to financial tools that were once reserved for institutions and the privileged few. It offers lending, staking, trading, and yield farming, all without needing a middleman. But for all its disruption, DeFi often feels like a cold and technical environment. Terms like “liquidity pools,” “slippage,” and “impermanent loss” dominate the conversation, while the human element — the why behind participation — often gets lost.\n\nWe talk a lot about what DeFi does, but rarely about how it makes people feel or who it represents.\n\nThis is where culture comes into play. In traditional finance, branding and public perception matter greatly. Think of names like Robinhood, Revolut, or Cash App — they succeed not just because of functionality, but because they connect emotionally with their users.\n\nCrypto has room to do the same. In fact, as Web3 becomes more mainstream, cultural identity, design, and storytelling will matter more than ever.\n\nEnter RizzFi: Confidence Meets Crypto\n\nThe name \"RizzFi\" may sound like a meme at first glance. “Rizz” is a slang term, often associated with charisma, charm, and social finesse — the ability to stand out and carry confidence. But don’t let that fool you. RizzFi is an idea that taps into something deeper.\n\nIt asks: What if we approached finance not just as a utility, but as a reflection of personal and cultural expression?\n\nRizzFi doesn’t propose a radically new DeFi protocol (at least not yet), but rather a new attitude around participation. It’s about making smart financial moves, but doing it with swagger. It’s about combining functionality with personality. In a world where most crypto platforms feel clinical and feature-heavy, RizzFi imagines an experience where users feel empowered — where using DeFi tools isn’t just practical, but aspirational.\n\nThis approach doesn’t mean ignoring security, transparency, or performance. It means designing with the user in mind — not just for usability, but for identity.\n\nSmart Money with Style\n\nWhat would it look like if DeFi apps had better UX?\nWhat if onboarding into a staking platform felt like joining an exclusive club?\nWhat if wallets didn’t just store assets but told your crypto story?\nThese are the kinds of ideas RizzFi encourages.\n\nImagine:\n\nA dashboard that doesn't just show your portfolio, but celebrates milestones.\n\nA staking pool that feels like joining a social circle.\n\nLeaderboards not for whales, but for wallet diversity and creative DeFi strategies.\n\nBadges that represent your “crypto journey” visually.\n\n\nAll of these are ways to gamify and humanize crypto — and it’s something Gen Z and younger millennials are already seeking.\n\nWhy Style Matters in Finance\n\nIt may seem strange to talk about “style” in something as serious as finance, but perception plays a powerful role in adoption. Look at how brands like Tesla, Apple, and Nike built empires not only on product performance, but cultural influence.\n\nIn the same way, crypto projects that balance substance with story, and data with design, are more likely to connect with a wider audience.\n\n[RizzFi](https://rizzFi.com), in that sense, isn’t trying to be everything to everyone. It’s for the crypto user who wants more than yield — they want experience, expression, and maybe a little flex along the way.\n\nIt’s a subtle reminder that how we interact with financial tools is just as important as what those tools do.\n\nNot Just Hype — A Call for Innovation\n\nOf course, the crypto community is right to be cautious. There are far too many meme coins, rug pulls, and hype-driven projects that lack real value. But RizzFi isn’t about empty marketing. It’s about raising the bar for how DeFi can feel, without sacrificing what makes it powerful in the first place.\n\nDesign, branding, and user experience should not be afterthoughts. They should be built into the foundation. Because let’s be honest — most DeFi platforms still look like spreadsheets from 2002.\n\nIf we want broader adoption, especially from younger, more design-savvy users, we need more projects that understand aesthetics and identity matter. RizzFi is a playful but powerful reminder that crypto can be cool, inclusive, and engaging — without compromising on decentralization or trustlessness.\n\nFinal Thoughts: DeFi with Drip\n\nSo, does crypto need rizz?\n\nMaybe not in the literal sense. But it does need personality. It needs better design. It needs experiences that users want to come back to. That’s what RizzFi represents — not just a product or protocol, but an idea. A direction where crypto is more than a tool — it’s a lifestyle.\n\nAnd maybe that’s how we get from niche to mainstream.\nNot just by solving technical problems, but by creating emotional connections.\nNot just by optimizing yield, but by maximizing meaning.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, people don’t just adopt tools — they adopt ideas.\n\nWelcome to RizzFi.\nFinance with flavor. Confidence in code.\nAnd yeah — we’ve got rizz.",

        "selftext": "At least 1.6M stolen from a wallet drainer in Apple's App Store - Cointelegraph reports! \n\nYesterday Cointelegraph doxxed a Web3 hacker for his role in the fake Rabby\\_IO Wallets that made it into the app store before the real one earlier this year.\n\nKonstantin Pylinskiy aka konpyl, CEO of Moonward Capital, is the person held responsible according to the Cointelegraph article. \n\nThis is the first instance I can recall of a major media company doxxing a hacker with a very detailed analysis of the theft!\n\nThe widely reported scam took place on Feb 16th 2024, but I'm showing based on victim reports it happened first on Dec 23rd 2023 and possibly as early as Oct 2023.\n\n[A twitter post from a user scammed by the fake Rabby Wallet on Dec 23rd 2023](https://preview.redd.it/b8ln123lvcvd1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0623fc8bad39c0036eb100f7733d9b81feac4db)\n\nI came across a few Support threads related to the fake Rabby wallets uploaded, one being here on Reddit, the other on a forum on Apple's own website.\n\nAdditionally, when the hack initially happened, most Media outlets reported the theft in the mid six figures. \n\nThe article by Cointelegraph mentions the amount at over 1.6 MILLION lost. A full accounting is needed to get the true number.\n\n# How the Fake Rabby Wallet Scam Happened\n\nTo get past Apple's strict review process with a wallet drainer not once, but at least twice, maybe even three times is quite the feat! If one of the most secure and trusted companies around can get scammed multiple time, no one is safe in web3!\n\nThe prevailing theory is the malicious developer of the fake Rabby Wallet applied to the iOS App Store under some generic fintech name. The app itself would appear innocent enough to the reviewer. \n\nOnce the app was approved, the developer was able to change the name to \"Rabby Wallet & Crypto Solution\" while inserting malicious code to turn that innocent little financial app into a vicious crypto drainer.\n\nWhen DeBank announced the launch of the real Rabby Wallet in the app store, the fake Rabby Wallet was already live while the real Rabby Wallet was still in Apple's approval process.\n\nThe accused bad actor, \"konpyl\", was able to drain numerous unsuspecting victims who thought they were engaging with the real Rabby Wallet, but instead got a fake one that targeted their crypto assets.\n\n# Tracing the Funds\n\n[Tracing the funds mentioned in the Cointelegraph article between 0x4E9395cc1075b57016BF8b5bF8782BFEF94c71C2 \\(left image\\) and 0x44BdB19dB1Cd29D546597AF7dc0549e7f6F9E480 \\(right image\\). ](https://preview.redd.it/h14ljc1c6dvd1.png?width=2756&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac8f20103059331d50ed35c0b6fa9264180608ae)\n\nThe flow of funds from the article can be extremely difficult to follow along at home but I'll do my best! A more detailed post about all of the wallets mentioned would make for a very lengthy analysis.\n\nThe research does look pretty spot on. The main connection I see to \"konpyl\" is that wallet with his former Opensea username - 0x44BdB19dB1Cd29D546597AF7dc0549e7f6F9E480 and the Rhinofi output wallet of 0x4E9395cc1075b57016BF8b5bF8782BFEF94c71C2 mentioned in the article.\n\nI counted 6 txns worth almost 100k and found some shared deposit address activity between the two wallets as well.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to get a true number of the total amount lost in the scam and wallets involved without a detailed analysis of the theft dates. 1.6M lost could be a conservative number and the total victim account could be much higher. \n\n# Apple's Role in the Theft\n\nIt's wild to think malicious web3 applications can consistently make it into Apple's App Store. Traditionally, Apple has had a \"hands off\" approach when it comes to these things.\n\nThe Cointelegraph article mentions Google's approach, which appears to put in some effort to stop bad actors by publicity going after individuals who abuse Google Play.\n\nI do think Apple has an obligation to protect users from any and all threats that appear in the App store.\n\nAlso due to the public nature of this theft, I'm hopeful for some recovery for some of the victims!\n\n",
